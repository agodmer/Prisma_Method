AB  - BACKGROUND: A growing body of observational evidence supports the value of
      ceftazidime-avibactam (CAZ-AVI) in managing infections caused by
      carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. METHODS: We retrospectively
      analyzed observational data on use and outcomes of CAZ-AVI therapy for
      infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing K.
      pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) strains. Multivariate regression analysis was used to
      identify variables independently associated with 30-day mortality. Results
      were adjusted for propensity score for receipt of CAZ-AVI combination
      regimens versus CAZ-AVI monotherapy. RESULTS: The cohort comprised 577
      adults with bloodstream infections (n = 391) or nonbacteremic infections
      involving mainly the urinary tract, lower respiratory tract, and
      intra-abdominal structures. All received treatment with CAZ-AVI alone (n =
      165) or with ≥1 other active antimicrobials (n = 412). The all-cause
      mortality rate 30 days after infection onset was 25% (146/577). There was
      no significant difference in mortality between patients managed with
      CAZ-AVI alone and those treated with combination regimens (26.1% vs 25.0%,
      P = .79). In multivariate analysis, mortality was positively associated
      with presence at infection onset of septic shock (P = .002), neutropenia
      (P < .001), or an INCREMENT score ≥8 (P = .01); with lower respiratory
      tract infection (LRTI) (P = .04); and with CAZ-AVI dose adjustment for
      renal function (P = .01). Mortality was negatively associated with CAZ-AVI
      administration by prolonged infusion (P = .006). All associations remained
      significant after propensity score adjustment. CONCLUSIONS: CAZ-AVI is an
      important option for treating serious KPC-Kp infections, even when used
      alone. Further study is needed to explore the drug's seemingly more
      limited efficacy in LRTIs and potential survival benefits of prolonging
      CAZ-AVI infusions to ≥3 hours.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The worldwide spread of carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative
      bacteria (GNB) in healthcare settings is worrying. Of particular concern
      is the occurrence of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing
      Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP). In recent years, several guidelines and
      recommendations have focused on the control of carbapenem-resistant GNB.
      It remains, however, unknown to what extent individual infection control
      measures are effective. Our aim was to critically review the recent
      evidence regarding the effectiveness of measures to control KPC-KP spread
      in healthcare settings. METHODS: Critical review of the literature aiming
      to evaluate, in accordance with published recommendations, all available
      studies reporting infection control (IC) measures to control KPC-KP
      published in the past 5 years. RESULTS: Among 11 included studies, the
      majority consisted of outbreak reports, where application of measures was
      reported in the absence of control groups. Variability was observed
      related to the frequency of application of recommended measures for
      control of KPC-KP. Additional measures were recorded, such as
      environmental sampling and staff screening, whereas compliance with hand
      hygiene was measured in relatively few studies. Finally, mortality in
      patients harbouring KPC-KP was notable, reaching 42.9% of included
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: Despite successful control of KPC-KP spread during
      outbreaks, the impact of individual IC measures is difficult to assess, as
      the quality of published evidence is low and controlled intervention
      studies are lacking. The distribution of studies, the number of reported
      cases and the high mortality rates, clearly show that KPC-KP remains a
      major healthcare problem worldwide.

AB  - Recently, emergence of carbapenem-resistance, in particular due to
      Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), was observed among K.
      pneumoniae causing urinary tract infections in Croatia. The aim of the
      study was to characterize, antimicrobial susceptibility, carbapenem
      resistance, virulence traits and plasmid types of the urinary KPC positive
      isolates of K. pneumoniae. The antimicrobial susceptibility to a wide
      range of antibiotics was determined by broth microdilution method. The
      transferability of meropenem resistance was determined by conjugation
      (broth mating method) employing Escherichia coli J63 strain resistant to
      sodium azide. Genes encoding broad and extended-spectrum β-lactamases,
      plasmid-mediated AmpC β-lactamases, group A and B carbapenemases, and
      carbapenem hydrolyzing oxacillinases (bla(OXA-48like)), respectively, were
      determined by Polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In total 30 KPC-positive K.
      pneumoniae urinary isolates collected from different regions of Croatia
      were analysed. The isolates were uniformly resistant to all tested
      antibiotics except for variable susceptibility to gentamicin,
      sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim, and colistin, respectively. Four isolates
      were resistant to colistin with MICs values ranging from 4 to 16 mg/L. All
      tested isolates were susceptible to ceftazidime/avibactam. Sixteen
      isolates transferred meropenem resistance to E. coli recipient strain by
      conjugation. Other resistance markers were not co-transferred. PCR was
      positive for bla(KPC) and bla(SHV) genes in all isolates whereas 13
      isolates tested positive also for bla(TEM) genes. PCR based replicon
      typing (PBRT) revealed the presence of FIIs in 13 and FIA plasmid in two
      strains. The study showed dissemination of KPC-producing K. pneumoniae in
      urinary isolates, posing a new epidemiological and treatment challenge.
      Sulphamethoxazole/trimethoprim, colistin, and ceftazidime/avibactam remain
      so far, as the therapeutic options.

AB  - First variants of the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), KPC-2 and
      KPC-3, have encountered a worldwide success, particularly in K. pneumoniae
      isolates. These beta-lactamases conferred resistance to most beta-lactams
      including carbapenems but remained susceptible to new
      beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitors, such as ceftazidime-avibactam.
      After the marketing of ceftazidime-avibactam, numerous variants of KPC
      resistant to this association have been described among isolates recovered
      from clinical samples or derived from experimental studies. In KPC
      variants resistant to ceftazidime-avibactam, point mutations, insertions
      and/or deletions have been described in various hot spots. Deciphering the
      impact of these mutations is crucial, not only from a therapeutic point of
      view, but also to follow the evolution in time and space of KPC variants
      resistant to ceftazidime-avibactam. In this review, we describe the
      mutational landscape of the KPC beta-lactamase toward
      ceftazidime-avibactam resistance based on a multidisciplinary approach
      including epidemiology, microbiology, enzymology, and thermodynamics. We
      show that resistance is associated with three hot spots, with a high
      representation of insertions and deletions compared with other class A
      beta-lactamases. Moreover, extension of resistance to
      ceftazidime-avibactam is associated with a trade-off in the resistance to
      other beta-lactams and a decrease in enzyme stability. Nevertheless, the
      high natural stability of KPC could underlay the propensity of this enzyme
      to acquire in vivo mutations conferring resistance to
      ceftazidime-avibactam (CAZavi), particularly via insertions and deletions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Emergence of KPC-2 and NDM-1-coproducing carbapenem-resistant
      Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-2-NDM-1-CRKP) has escalated threat of CRKP to
      healthcare. Currently, only 4 isolates had been reported sporadically. It
      remains unclear how KPC-2-NDM-1-CRKPs emerged, and whether they are stable
      and have transmission capacity. METHODS: PCR and Sanger sequencing was
      used to screen carbapenemase genes for 2057 CRKP isolates, to identify
      KPC-2-NDM-1-CRKPs. The clinical information of the patients was collected
      from medical records. Antimicrobial susceptibility, plasmid stability,
      plasmid conjugation and growth curve were measured. The whole genomes were
      sequenced on PacBio and Illumina platforms. Similar plasmids were searched
      against public database. Phylogenetic tree was built based on related
      genomes which carried similar plasmids, to infer the evolutionary history
      of KPC-2-NDM-1-CRKP. FINDINGS: We identified to date the largest cohort of
      7 KPC-2-NDM-1-CRKPs. An increased incidence rate was observed. Plasmid
      transferability assay and phylogenic analysis suggested an evolutionary
      pathway that KPC-2-NDM-1-CRKP emerged from a KPC-2-CRKP progenitor which
      acquired another highly transferable bla(NDM-1) plasmid later. Further,
      demographics and stability test revealed that these isolates were stable
      and had the potential for transmission among patients. INTERPRETATION: Our
      study extends our concern on KPC-2-NDM-1-CRKP about its high stability and
      non-inferior fitness, sheds light on the evolution of KPC-2-NDM-1-CRKP,
      strengthens the importance of continued surveillance on these isolates,
      and would improve clinical treatment and management. FUNDING: This work
      was supported by National Natural Science Foundation for Distinguished

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The emergence of carbapenemase resistant Gram-negative is
      designated as an 'urgent' priority of public health. Carbapenemase
      producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (CPKP) is linked with significant
      mortality. Conventionally used antibiotics (polymyxins, tigecycline,
      aminoglycosides, etc.) are associated with poor efficacy and toxicity
      profiles are quite worrisome. AREAS COVERED: This article reviews
      mechanism of resistance and evidence regarding novel treatments of
      infections caused by CPKP, focusing mainly on currently approved new
      therapies and implications on future therapeutic strategies. A review of
      novel β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors (BLI) recently approved and in
      clinical development as well as cefiderocol, eravacycline and apramycin
      are discussed. EXPERT OPINION: Newly approved and forthcoming
      antimicrobial agents are promising to combat infections caused by CPKP.
      Ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, and
      imipenem-cilastatin-relebactam are novel agents with favorable outcome and
      associated with improved mortality in KPC-producing K. pneumoniae
      infections. However, are inactive against metallo-β-lactamases (MBL).
      Novel BLI in later stage of development, i.e. aztreonam-avibactam,
      cefepime-zidebactam, cefepime-taniborbactam, and meropenem-nacubactam as
      well as cefiderocol are active in vitro against both KPC and MBL.
      Potential expectations of future therapeutic strategies are improved
      potency against CPKP, more tolerable safety profile, and capability of
      overcoming current resistance mechanism of multidrug-resistant K.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim was to investigate the activity of
      ceftazidime/avibactam (CAZ/AVI) against carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella
      pneumoniae (CRKP) and identify the resistance mechanisms before CAZ/AVI
      coming to Chinese market. METHODS: Clinical CRKP isolates were
      continuously collected from 36 tertiary hospitals in China from 1 March
      2017 to 31 July 2017. CAZ/AVI MICs were determined by agar dilution
      method. CAZ/AVI resistant isolates were submitted to whole genome
      sequencing. The copy number and relative expression of bla(KPC) were
      determined by quantitative PCR. RESULTS: A total of 872 CRKP isolates were
      collected, and MIC(50) and MIC(90) of CAZ/AVI were 4 and 8 mg/L. The
      resistant rate of CAZ/AVI was 3.7% (32/872). Among the resistant isolates,
      53.1% (17/32) were metallo-β-lactamase-producing K. pneumoniae (MBL-KP),
      40.6% (13/32) were Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K.
      pneumoniae (KPC-KP) and 6.3% (2/32) produced both MBL and KPC. One of the
      KPC-KP with high level CAZ/AVI resistance (>128 mg/L) harboured mutated
      bla(KPC-2) (D179Y). In 12 wild-type bla(KPC-2) isolates, the relative copy
      number and expression of bla(KPC-2) gene were 2.5-fold and 2.7-fold higher
      than that in the CAZ/AVI MIC ≤0.5 mg/L group (p < 0.05), and when added
      avibactam at a fixed concentration of 8 mg/L, 91.7% (11/12) isolates could
      restore susceptibility. CONCLUSIONS: Resistance against CAZ/AVI in CRKP
      emerged before clinical use of CAZ/AVI in China, although most of the CRKP
      isolates maintained the susceptibility. MBL production, bla(KPC-2) point
      mutation and high KPC expression played an important role in CAZ/AVI
      resistance.

AB  - Ceftazidime is a 3rd generation cephalosporin active against Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa. Avibactam is an inhibitor of class A, C and some class D
      β-lactamases. The antibacterial spectrum of ceftazidime-avibactam covers
      95% of P. aeruginosa isolates and >99% of enterobacteria, including
      strains carrying extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs). Selection of
      resistant mutants in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae
      strains producing KPC-3 or KPC-2 after exposure to ceftazidime-avibactam
      has been described by the appearance of one or more amino acid changes in
      the Ω-loop of the β-lactamase. These strains usually regain susceptibility
      to meropenem. There is evidence of a shorter multidrug-resistant organisms
      colonization period in patients treated with this antimicrobial, which
      could be beneficial in the treatment of infections caused by bacteria
      carrying ESBLs or carbapenemases.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing bacteria is a group of
      highly dangerous antibiotic resistant Gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae.
      They cause infections associated with significant morbidity and mortality.
      Therefore, the rapid detection of KPC-producing bacteria plays a key role
      in clinical microbiology. Matrix assisted laser desorption/ionization
      time-of- flight (MALDI-TOF) is a rapidly evolving technology that finds
      application in various clinical, scientific, and industrial disciplines.
      In the present study, we demonstrated three different procedures of
      carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae (KPC) detection. The most basic
      model of MALDI-TOF instrument MS Microflex LT was used, operating in the
      linear ion-positive mode, commonly used in modern clinical laboratories.
      The first procedure was based on indirect monitoring of carbapenemase
      production with direct detection of hydrolyzed carbapenem antibiotic
      degradation products in the mass spectrum. The second procedure was based
      on direct detection of bla(KPC) accompanying peak with an 11,109 Da in the
      mass spectrum of carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae (KPC), which
      represents the cleaved protein (pKpQIL_p019) expressed by pKpQIL plasmid.
      In addition, several unique peaks were detected in the
      carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae (KPC) mass spectrum. The third
      procedure was the identification of carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae
      (KPC) based on the protein fingerprint using local database created from
      the whole mass spectra. By comparing detection procedures, we determined
      that the third procedure was very fast and relatively easy. However, it
      requires previous verification of carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae
      (KPC) using other methods as genetic bla(KPC) identification, detection of
      carbapenem degradation products, and accompanying peak with 11,109 Da,
      which represents cleaved pKpQIL_p019 protein expressed by pKpQIL plasmid.
      Detection of carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae using MALDI-TOF
      provides fast and accurate results that may help to reduce morbidity and
      mortality in hospital setting when applied in diagnostic situations.

AB  - Hypervirulent carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (hv-CRKP) has
      recently aroused increasing attention, especially ST11, the predominant
      CRKP clone in China. Here, we report a case of hv-CRKP-associated
      infection and reveal the in-host evolution of its mechanism of resistance
      to tigecycline and polymyxin under clinical therapy. A total of 11 K.
      pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing CRKP strains were consecutively
      isolated from a male patient who suffered from continuous and multisite
      infections. String and antimicrobial susceptibility tests identified seven
      hypermucoviscous strains and three tigecycline-resistant and four
      colistin-resistant strains. Galleria mellonella larvae infection model
      confirmed the hypervirulence. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
      separated three PFGE clusters among all strains, and further Southern
      blotting detected that bla(KPC-2) was located on the same-sized plasmid.
      Whole-genome sequencing showed that all strains belonged to the hv-CRKP
      ST11-KL64 clone. Diverse hypervirulence factors and resistance genes were
      identified. Further sequencing with the Nanopore platform was performed on
      the CRKP-Urine1 strain, which contained one virulence plasmid
      (pVi-CRKP-Urine1) and two resistance plasmids (pKPC-CRKP-Urine1 and
      pqnrS1-CRKP-Urine1). The gene mutations responsible for tigecycline or
      colistin resistance were then amplified with PCR followed by sequencing,
      which indicated that mutations of ramR and lon were the potential loci for
      tigecycline resistance and that the pmrB, phoQ and mgrB genes for colistin
      resistance. A novel frameshift mutation of lon was identified in the
      high-level tigecycline-resistant strain (MIC, 128 mg/L). The results
      indicate that the hypervirulent ST11-KL64 clone is a potential threat to
      antiinfection treatment and is capable of rapid and diverse evolution of
      resistance during tigecycline and polymyxin treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the overall distributions of key virulence genes
      in Klebsiella pneumoniae, especially the hypervirulent bla(KPC)-positive
      K. pneumoniae (Hv-bla(KPC)(+)-KP). METHODS: A total of 521 complete
      genomes of K. pneumoniae from GenBank were collected and analyzed.
      Multilocus sequence typing, molecular serotyping, antibiotic-resistance,
      virulence genes and plasmid replicon typing were investigated. RESULTS:
      Positive rates of virulence genes highly varied, ranging from 2.9
      (c-rmpA/A2) to 99.6% (entB). Totally 207 strains presented positive fimH,
      mrkD, entB and wzi and 190 showed positive fimH, mrkD, entB, irp2 and wzi,
      which were the two primary modes. A total of 94, 165 and 29 strains were
      denoted as hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (HvKP), bla(KPC)(+)-KP and
      Hv-bla(KPC)(+)-KP. ST11 accounted for 17 among the 29 Hv-bla(KPC)(+)-KP
      strains; Genes iucA, p-rmpA2 and p-rmpA were positive in 28, 26 and 18
      Hv-bla(KPC)(+)-KP strains respectively. Among the 29 Hv-bla(KPC)(+)-KP
      strains exhibiting four super clusters from GenBank, IncHI1B plasmids
      carrying virulence genes and IncFII ones with bla(KPC) were responsible
      for both 23 strains respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Positive rates of virulence
      genes vary remarkably in K. pneumoniae. Genes iucA, p-rmpA2 and p-rmpA
      were primary ones inducing Hv-bla(KPC)(+)-KP. IncHI1B plasmids carrying
      virulence genes and IncFII ones with bla(KPC) constitute the primary
      combination responsible for Hv-bla(KPC)(+)-KP. The making of
      Hv-bla(KPC)(+)-KP is mostly via bla(KPC)(+)-KP acquiring another plasmid
      harboring virulence genes.

AB  - Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae, represent a major threat to
      public health due to their rapid spread. Novel drug combinations such as
      ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA), combining a broad-spectrum cephalosporin
      along with a broad-spectrum β-lactamase inhibitor, have recently been
      introduced and have been shown to exhibit excellent activity toward
      multidrug-resistant KPC-producing Enterobacterales strains. However,
      CZA-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates are now being increasingly reported,
      mostly corresponding to producers of KPC variants. In this study, we
      evaluated in vitro the nature of the mutations in the KPC-2 and KPC-3
      β-lactamase sequences (the most frequent KPC-type enzymes) that lead to
      CZA resistance and the subsequent effects of these mutations on
      susceptibility to other β-lactam antibiotics. Single-step in vitro
      selection assays were conducted, resulting in the identification of a
      series of mutations in the KPC sequence which conferred the ability of
      those mutated enzymes to confer resistance to CZA. Hence, 16 KPC-2
      variants and 10 KPC-3 variants were obtained. Production of the KPC
      variants in an Escherichia coli recombinant strain resulted in a
      concomitant increased susceptibility to broad-spectrum cephalosporins and
      carbapenems, with the exceptions of ceftazidime and
      piperacillin-tazobactam, compared to wild-type KPC enzymes. Enzymatic
      assays showed that all of the KPC variants identified exhibited an
      increased affinity toward ceftazidime and a slightly decreased sensitivity
      to avibactam, sustaining their impact on CZA resistance. However, their
      respective carbapenemase activities were concurrently negatively impacted.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the incidence of
      ceftazidime/avibactam resistance among Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase
      (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) strains isolated from patients with
      bloodstream infection. METHODS: We collected 120 carbapenemase producing
      Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) strains from unique patients hospitalized in two
      Italian hospitals between January 2018 to February 2019. Strains were
      phenotypically characterized for the type of carbapenemase production and
      susceptibility to ceftazidime/avibactam. Ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant
      strains were characterized by whole-genome sequencing. RESULTS: During the
      study period, we characterized 105 (87.5%) KPC producers among a total of
      120 CPE strains. Ceftazidime/avibactam resistance was found in three
      KPC-Kp strains isolated from patients with no history of previous
      ceftazidime/avibactam-based treatment. Of note, two out of three
      ceftazidime-avibactam-resistant KPC-Kp were also resistant to
      meropenem/vaborbactam. Genomic characterization showed that a
      ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant KPC-Kp harboured a mixed population with
      D179Y mutated KPC-2, while the other two ceftazidime-avibactam-resistant
      KPC-Kp possessed non-functional ompK35-ompK37 and mutated ompK36 porins
      associated with higher copy number of bla(KPC) gene. CONCLUSIONS: Our
      results showed that incidence of ceftazidime/avibactam resistance emerged
      in KCP-Kp strains independently from previous antimicrobial exposure.
      Resistance to ceftazidime/avibactam was associated with mutations within
      the bla(KPC) gene or porin deficiency associated with higher bla(KPC) copy
      number and is also related to the meropenem/vaborbactam resistance.

AB  - Bloodstream infections (BSIs) caused by carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella
      pneumoniae (CRKP) are potentially life-threatening and an urgent threat to
      public health. The present study aims to clarify the characteristics of
      carbapenemase-encoding and virulent plasmids, and their interactions with
      the host bacterium. A total of 425 Kp isolates were collected from the
      blood of BSI patients from nine Chinese hospitals, between 2005 and 2019.
      Integrated epidemiological and genomic data showed that ST11 and ST307 Kp
      isolates were associated with nosocomial outbreak and transmission.
      Comparative analysis of 147 Kp genomes and 39 completely assembled
      chromosomes revealed extensive interruption of acrR by ISKpn26 in all Kp
      carbapenemase-2 (KPC-2)-producing ST11 Kp isolates, leading to activation
      of the AcrAB-Tolc multidrug efflux pump and a subsequent reduction in
      susceptibility to the last-resort antibiotic tigecycline and six other
      antibiotics. We described 29 KPC-2 plasmids showing diverse structures,
      two virulence plasmids in two KPC-2-producing Kp, and two novel
      multidrug-resistant (MDR)-virulent plasmids. This study revealed a
      multifactorial impact of KPC-2 plasmid on Kp, which may be associated with
      nosocomial dissemination of MDR isolates.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with bacteremia due to carbapenem-resistant
      Enterobacterales (CRE) experience delays until appropriate therapy and
      high mortality rates. Rapid molecular diagnostics for carbapenemases and
      new β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors may improve outcomes. METHODS: We
      conducted an observational study of patients with CRE bacteremia from 2016
      to 2018 at 8 New York and New Jersey medical centers and assessed
      center-specific clinical microbiology practices. We compared time to
      receipt of active antimicrobial therapy and mortality between patients
      whose positive blood cultures underwent rapid molecular testing for the
      Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) gene (blaKPC) and patients whose
      cultures did not undergo this test. CRE isolates underwent antimicrobial
      susceptibility testing by broth microdilution and carbapenemase profiling
      by whole-genome sequencing. We also assessed outcomes when
      ceftazidime-avibactam and polymyxins were used as targeted therapies.
      RESULTS: Of 137 patients with CRE bacteremia, 89 (65%) had a KPC-producing
      organism. Patients whose blood cultures underwent blaKPC PCR testing (n =
      51) had shorter time until receipt of active therapy (median: 24 vs 50
      hours; P = .009) compared with other patients (n = 86) and decreased
      14-day (16% vs 37%; P = .007) and 30-day (24% vs 47%; P = .007) mortality.
      blaKPC PCR testing was associated with decreased 30-day mortality
      (adjusted odds ratio: .37; 95% CI: .16-.84) in an adjusted model. The
      30-day mortality rate was 10% with ceftazidime-avibactam monotherapy and
      31% with polymyxin monotherapy (P = .08). CONCLUSIONS: In a KPC-endemic
      area, blaKPC PCR testing of positive blood cultures was associated with
      decreased time until appropriate therapy and decreased mortality for CRE
      bacteremia, and ceftazidime-avibactam is a reasonable first-line therapy
      for these infections.

      imipenem/cilastatin-relebactam-regarding treatment of Klebsiella
      pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (KPC). Data Sources: A
      literature search of PubMed and OVID (MEDLINE) was performed up to March
      2020 using the following search terms: Vabomere, meropenem-vaborbactam,
      vaborbactam, RPX7009, Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase, KPC,
      carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, CRE, relebactam,
      imipenem-relebactam, MK-7655, ceftazidime-avibactam. Abstracts from
      conferences, article bibliographies, and product information were also
      reviewed. Study Selection and Data Extraction: Articles were first
      screened by English language, then title, then abstract, and finally by
      review of the full article. Fifty-five clinical and preclinical studies
      were included. Data Synthesis: These 3 novel β-lactam/β-lactamase
      inhibitor combinations have shown considerable improvement in safety and
      efficacy as compared with traditional polymyxin-based combination therapy
      for the treatment of KPC infections. While meropenem-vaborbactam has not
      shown improved activity against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, it has shown
      decreased rates of resistance to KPC versus ceftazidime-avibactam.
      Conclusions: With increasing incidence of KPC infections on a global
      scale, pharmacists should be aware of the notable similarities and
      differences between these 3 agents, and the current data supporting their
      use. Pharmacists may want to consider meropenem-vaborbactam over
      ceftazidime-avibactam for KPC infections due to decreased likelihood of
      resistance.

      KPC-Kp impact in the ICU should take into consideration not only
      characteristics of the individuals, but also of the health systems
      including length of stay, costs and hospital organization issues.
      Estimates of mortality reported in the current literature are weakened by
      the poor quality of adjustment for age-specific risks, co-morbidities, and
      appropriateness of therapy. All these confounding factors should be taken
      into account in models, with consideration of control groups and competing
      risks that is currently lacking in the published literature. Since
      development of antibiotic resistance is an unstoppable phenomenon and
      economic and human resources are facing progressive limitations due to
      budget constraints, cost-saving strategies targeted to avoid ICU closure,
      temporary limitation of admissions or delayed hospital discharge are
      necessary. The early identification of KPC-Kp-colonized patients through
      active screening strategies is likely to be the cornerstone of such a
      cost-saving strategy. However, there are still many open issues concerning
      which of these strategies are the most effective. Owing to extreme
      heterogeneity and several methodological flaws in current publications,
      future studies investigating the long-term sequelae and economic impact of
      KPC-Kp in the ICU are urgently needed.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Carbapenemase-producing strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC)
      are a great health concern, and therapy with ceftazidime-avibactam
      represents a choice for the treatment of infections involving these
      strains. We report a strain resistant to ceftazidime-avibactam due to a
      deletion of six nucleotides in the bla(KPC) gene sequence. METHODS: Two
      strains, namely AMP920 and AMP2009, were isolated from the same patient a
      month apart. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed both by
      broth microdilution and by Etest. Immunoenzymatic assay to detect
      carbapenemase was performed for both strains. The bla(KPC) gene of both
      strains was amplified by PCR and sequenced. Enzyme activity towards
      carbapenems was tested by the CarbaNP test and hydrolysis
      spectrophotometer assay. RESULTS: The two isolates differed in
      antimicrobial susceptibility. AMP920 showed meropenem and imipenem
      resistance (MIC 32 and 32 mg/mL). A month later the carbapenem MIC
      decreased to 8 and 1 mg/mL respectively, while the ceftazidime-avibactam
      MIC increased from 1 to 16 mg/mL. Both isolates showed a positive
      immunoenzymatic test for the KPC enzyme, but only AMP920 showed a positive
      CarbaNP test hydrolysing imipenem. The Bla(KPC) gene was amplified in both
      strains. After sequencing, the two amplicons showed a KPC3 variant. The
      gene of the second isolate showed a deletion of six nucleotides at
      498-503, resulting in a mutant variant with the deletion of glutamic acid
      and leucine residues at positions 167 and 168. CONCLUSIONS: We detected a
      new deletion in the bla(KPC) gene of a clinical strain of K. pneumoniae
      which resulted in resistance to ceftazidime-avibactam. The amino acids
      deleted are in the Ω loop (amino acids 165-179) of the KPC enzyme,
      enhancing ceftazidime affinity and preventing avibactam binding.

AB  - Klebsiella oxytoca is actually a complex of nine species-Klebsiella
      grimontii, Klebsiella huaxiensis, Klebsiella michiganensis, K. oxytoca,
      Klebsiella pasteurii, Klebsiella spallanzanii, and three unnamed novel
      species. Phenotypic tests can assign isolates to the complex, but precise
      species identification requires genome-based analysis. The K. oxytoca
      complex is a human commensal but also an opportunistic pathogen causing
      various infections, such as antibiotic-associated hemorrhagic colitis
      (AAHC), urinary tract infection, and bacteremia, and has caused outbreaks.
      Production of the cytotoxins tilivalline and tilimycin lead to AAHC, while
      many virulence factors seen in Klebsiella pneumoniae, such as capsular
      polysaccharides and fimbriae, have been found in the complex; however,
      their association with pathogenicity remains unclear. Among the 5,724 K.
      oxytoca clinical isolates in the SENTRY surveillance system, the rates of
      nonsusceptibility to carbapenems, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin, colistin,
      and tigecycline were 1.8%, 12.5%, 7.1%, 0.8%, and 0.1%, respectively.
      Resistance to carbapenems is increasing alarmingly. In addition to the
      intrinsic bla(OXY), many genes encoding β-lactamases with varying spectra
      of hydrolysis, including extended-spectrum β-lactamases, such as a few
      CTX-M variants and several TEM and SHV variants, have been found.
      bla(KPC-2) is the most common carbapenemase gene found in the complex and
      is mainly seen on IncN or IncF plasmids. Due to the ability to acquire
      antimicrobial resistance and the carriage of multiple virulence genes, the
      K. oxytoca complex has the potential to become a major threat to human
      health.

AB  - Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) is emerging as a
      worldwide public health concern; however, the long-term molecular
      epidemiological surveillance of clinical CRKP in China is limited. We
      conducted a retrospective observational study (2008-2018) to assess the
      prevalence, susceptibility, risk factors and molecular epidemiology of
      clinical CRKP isolates. We found the prevalence of CRKP increased from
      2.5%, 2008 to 15.8%, 2018. CRKP were significantly more frequent among
      hospitalized patients from ICU, and it was significantly more likely to be
      isolated from the capital city (Hangzhou) and the patients aged ≥60 years.
      Additionally, seasons and specimen types were associated with CRKP
      infections. The main CRKP sequence type (ST) was ST11, and bla (KPC-2) was
      the most prevalent gene variant. Together these data reveal an increasing
      incidence and resistance trends among CRKP, especially the ST11-bla
      (KPC-2)-CRKP, in Zhejiang, during 2008-2018. Our findings are important
      for hospitals to limit its dissemination and optimize antibiotic
      administration.

AB  - Recently, various bla(KPC-2) variants resistant to ceftazidime-avibactam
      have begun to emerge in clinical settings, but it is unclear which testing
      method is most appropriate for detecting these variants. Strains were
      subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing using the broth
      microdilution method. Four carbapenemase detection methods, modified
      carbapenem inactivation method (mCIM) and EDTA carbapenem inactivation
      method (eCIM), APB/EDTA (carbapenemase inhibitor APB [3-aminophenylboronic
      acid] and EDTA enhancement method), NG-test Carba 5, and GeneXpert Carba-R
      were used to try to detect KPC-2 variants in 19 Klebsiella pneumoniae
      isolates. Among those bla(KPC-2) variants, bla(KPC-33)-, bla(KPC-35)-,
      bla(KPC-71)-, bla(KPC-76)-, bla(KPC-78)-, and bla(KPC-79)-positive
      isolates accounted for 26.3% (5/19), 15.8% (3/19), 5.3% (1/19), % 42.1%
      (8/19), 5.3% (1/19), and 5.3% (1/19), respectively. All 19 K. pneumoniae
      carrying bla(KPC-2) variants showed resistance to ceftazidime-avibactam
      (MICs:16 to >64 mg/L), and 14 strains were susceptible to imipenem (MICs:
      0.25 to 1 mg/L). None of the bla(KPC-2) variants could be detected using
      either the mCIM or the APB/EDTA method, while five strains carrying
      bla(KPC-2) variants (bla(KPC-35), bla(KPC-78), and bla(KPC-79)) tested KPC
      positive when using NG-test Carba 5. However, GeneXpert Carba-R was able
      to detect bla(KPC-2) variants (harboring bla(KPC-33), bla(KPC-35),
      bla(KPC-71), bla(KPC-76), bla(KPC-78), and bla(KPC-79)) carried by all 19
      K. pneumoniae. The emergence of new KPC variants poses an increased
      challenge for carbapenemase detection methods, and laboratories should use
      the appropriate assays to accurately detect these variants. IMPORTANCE
      Carbapenemase detection is essential for the appropriate treatment of CRE
      infections. Several clinical laboratories have begun using relevant
      carbapenemase assays such as mCIM and eCIM, the APB/EDTA method, NG-test
      Carba 5, and GeneXpert Carba-R to detect carbapenemases. Nevertheless,
      some of these methods may have limitations for detecting bla(KPC-2)
      variants. Additionally, there has been little relevant research on
      evaluate the differences between these standard methods for detecting
      bla(KPC-2) variants. Therefore, we investigated the reliability of these
      classic methods for assessing 19 K. pneumoniae with bla(KPC-2) variants.
      Our results showed that none of the bla(KPC-2) variants could be detected
      using either the mCIM or APB/EDTA method, while five strains (harboring
      bla(KPC-35), bla(KPC-78),and bla(KPC-79)) tested KPC positive when using
      NG-test Carba 5. GeneXpert Carba-R could detect six bla(KPC-2) variants
      carried by all 19 K. pneumoniae. This study may be valuable for clinical
      laboratories in their efforts to test for various bla(KPC-2) variants.

AB  - Class A serine β-lactamases (SBLs) are key antibiotic resistance
      determinants in Gram-negative bacteria. SBLs neutralize β-lactams via a
      hydrolytically labile covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate. Klebsiella
      pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) is a widespread SBL that hydrolyzes
      carbapenems, the most potent β-lactams; known KPC variants differ in
      turnover of expanded-spectrum oxyimino-cephalosporins (ESOCs), for
      example, cefotaxime and ceftazidime. Here, we compare ESOC hydrolysis by
      the parent enzyme KPC-2 and its clinically observed double variant
      (P104R/V240G) KPC-4. Kinetic analyses show that KPC-2 hydrolyzes
      cefotaxime more efficiently than the bulkier ceftazidime, with improved
      ESOC turnover by KPC-4 resulting from enhanced turnover (k(cat)), rather
      than altered K(M) values. High-resolution crystal structures of ESOC
      acyl-enzyme complexes with deacylation-deficient (E166Q) KPC-2 and KPC-4
      mutants show that ceftazidime acylation causes rearrangement of three
      loops; the Ω, 240, and 270 loops, which border the active site. However,
      these rearrangements are less pronounced in the KPC-4 than the KPC-2
      ceftazidime acyl-enzyme and are not observed in the KPC-2:cefotaxime
      acyl-enzyme. Molecular dynamics simulations of KPC:ceftazidime
      acyl-enyzmes reveal that the deacylation general base E166, located on the
      Ω loop, adopts two distinct conformations in KPC-2, either pointing "in"
      or "out" of the active site; with only the "in" form compatible with
      deacylation. The "out" conformation was not sampled in the KPC-4
      acyl-enzyme, indicating that efficient ESOC breakdown is dependent upon
      the ordering and conformation of the KPC Ω loop. The results explain how
      point mutations expand the activity spectrum of the clinically important
      KPC SBLs to include ESOCs through their effects on the conformational
      dynamics of the acyl-enzyme intermediate.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study aimed to determine the molecular characteristics of
      carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) isolates in a hospital
      in western Chongqing, southwestern China. METHODS: A total of 127 unique
      CRKP isolates were collected from the Yongchuan Hospital of Chongqing
      Medical University, identified using a VITEK-2 compact system, and
      subjected to microbroth dilution to determine the minimal inhibitory
      concentration. Enterobacteriaceae intergenic repeat consensus polymerase
      chain reaction and multilocus sequence typing were used to analyze the
      homology among the isolates. Genetic information, including resistance and
      virulence genes, was assessed using polymerase chain reaction. The genomic
      features of the CRKP carrying gene bla(KPC-2) were detected using
      whole-genome sequencing. RESULTS: ST11 was the dominant sequence type in
      the homology comparison. The resistance rate to ceftazidime-avibactam in
      children was much higher than that in adults as was the detection rate of
      the resistance gene bla(NDM) (p < 0.0001). Virulence genes such as mrkD
      (97.6%), uge (96.9%), kpn (96.9%), and fim-H (84.3%) had high detection
      rates. IncF (57.5%) was the major replicon plasmid detected, and
      sequencing showed that the CRKP063 genome contained two plasmids. The
      plasmid carrying bla(KPC-2), which mediates carbapenem resistance, was
      located on the 359,625 base pair plasmid IncFII, together with virulence
      factors, plasmid replication protein (rep B), stabilizing protein (par A),
      and type IV secretion system (T4SS) proteins that mediate plasmid
      conjugation transfer. CONCLUSION: Our study aids in understanding the
      prevalence of CRKP in this hospital and the significant differences
      between children and adults, thus providing new ideas for clinical
      empirical use of antibiotics.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To provide, for the first time, data on the molecular
      epidemiology of carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical
      isolates from the northern region of Portugal (Trás-os-Montes and Alto
      Douro). METHODS: A total of 106 carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae
      isolates recovered from clinical samples and rectal swabs between January
      2018 and March 2019 were included in this study. All isolates were
      characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility, identification of
      resistance determinants, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE),
      multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and plasmid analysis. RESULTS: The most
      common carbapenemase identified was KPC-2 (91%), followed by OXA-48 (9%).
      The bla(KPC-2) gene was carried onto IncN (60%) and IncF (40%) plasmid
      types, whereas the bla(OXA-48) gene was mainly located on the IncL (90%)
      incompatibility group. Molecular characterization distributed the 106
      isolates into 29 PFGE types and 21 sequence types (STs), but three clones
      included 50% of the isolates: PFGE A-ST147-KPC-2 (29%), B-ST15-KPC-2
      (15%), and C-ST11-OXA-48 (6%). Antimicrobial resistance rates were the
      following: ciprofloxacin (76%), trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (75%),
      tobramycin (62%), gentamicin (34%), amikacin (25%), tigecycline (21%),
      fosfomycin (10%), and colistin (7%). None of the colistin-resistant
      isolates harboured mcr genes. All isolates remained susceptible to
      ceftazidime/avibactam, but 10% presented elevated MICs (3 and 4mg/L).
      CONCLUSIONS: KPC-2 was the predominant carbapenemase among K. pneumoniae
      isolates currently circulating at this hospital from northern Portugal,
      followed by OXA-48. These data contrast with those obtained from the rest
      of the country, where KPC-3 predominates. This study showed a polyclonal
      structure of KPC-2-producing K. pneumoniae isolates with a predominance of
      the ST147 and ST15 clones.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The serine carbapenemase enzymes (KPC) which produce from
      bacteria klebsiella pneumoniae today have been emerged as one of the
      β-lactamase enzymes that is capable to inactivating the last line of
      carbapenems. The gene encoding the K. pneumonia (bla(KPC)) belongs to gene
      carried on plasmid among Enterobacteriaceae family, which has modulation
      for the infections control so this study is aimed to spot the presence and
      evaluate bla(KPC) gene expression by real-time PCR in local isolates of K.
      pneumonia. METHODS: Forty-seven of K. pneumonia isolates were isolated
      from different clinical samples (blood, sputum, urine, wounds and burns)
      from patients in separate hospitals in Baghdad., Antimicrobial sensitivity
      test was carried out by vitik-2 system and Kirby- Bauer method. The PCR
      was employed to detect carbapenemase gene. RESULTS: The results of this
      study showed that all explored isolates were resistant to Ertapenem,
      Meropenem and imipenem 47(100%). Phenotypically, all the isolates had
      carbapenemase which hydrolyzed the carbapenem antibiotics. Furthermore,
      the isolates showed (100%) resistance to Cefazolin, Ampicillin and
      Amoxicillin/ Clavulic acid. However, the most effective antibiotic was
      Levofloxacin (91.5%). The results of conventional PCR technique for the
      detection of bla(KPC) gene showed that 38 (80.9%) isolates of
      carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae harboured bla(KPC) gene (1010 bp),
      while none carried other carbapenemase genes including bla(NDM1), bla(VIM)
      and bla(IMP) genes. High levels of carbapenem resistance was clarified by
      the imipenem and meropenem MICs determination. All 38 isolates were
      positive in CNPT. Furthermore, the 38 isolates showed over expression of
      bla(KPC) gene compared with housekeeping rpo gene in Real-Time PCR.
      CONCLUSIONS: According to these results, the resistant isolates to
      carbapenem were belong to the present and high level expression of
      bla(KPC) gene in our local isolates.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: The presence of carbapenemase enzymes among
      Enterobacterales is the main mechanism to reduce susceptibility to a wide
      range of antibiotics. Carbapenemase enzymes such as the Klebsiella
      pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) hydrolyse beta-lactam antibiotics group,
      which includes carbapenem, leads to fewer treatment options. We aim to
      describe the first report of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP)
      sequence type (ST) 11 harbouring KPC in Oman. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Five
      confirmed CRKP isolates were isolated from clinical samples during the
      period of January 2019 till December 2019. Strains were genotyped by pulse
      field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) for genetic relatedness. Whole genome
      sequencing (WGS) was performed to observe relationships with global
      strains using multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Antimicrobial genes,
      capsular loci-K-types, plasmids types and virulence genes were also
      identified using whole genome sequence data. RESULTS: All five CRKP were
      determined to have bla(KPC-2) with or without bla(OX-A48) and bla(NDM-2).
      The molecular genotyping by PFGE showed 100% similarity among the five
      isolates. The MLST allelic profile analysis clonally clustered our strains
      with SL-258, CG-11 and ST11 mainly reported from South Asia. Further
      molecular characterization of the capsular K-locus and O-locus genes,
      revealed the strains to belong to KL-47 type and OL101 type respectively.
      The core genome typing suggests that our strains were clonally related to
      Chinese strains with less than five chromosomal nucleotides differences.
      CONCLUSION: Epidemiological and molecular analyses confirmed that these
      KPC-producing K. pneumoniae strains are from a single clone that caused
      multiple nosocomial infections in one health institution. This finding
      highlights the importance to sustain the surveillance and infection
      prevention efforts and to step up active screening to prevent the spread
      of nosocomial infection.

AB  - This study aimed to investigate the dissemination and characteristics of
      bla(KPC), bla(NDM), bla(OXA-48-like) , bla(IMP), and bla(VIM) among the
      carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) strains isolated from adult
      and children patients. A total of 935 non-duplicate CRE strains were
      collected from 36 hospitals in 24 provinces or cities across China from
      2016 to 2018. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by broth
      microdilution method and carbapenemase genes bla(KPC), bla(NDM),
      bla(OXA-48-like) , bla(IMP), and bla(VIM) were screened by PCR and
      confirmed by DNA sequencing. Overall, carbapenemases were produced in
      97.4% (911/935) of CRE strains, including KPC-2 (51.6%, 482/935), NDM
      (35.7%, 334/935), and OXA-48-like carbapenemases (7.3%, 68/935). Overall,
      the most prevalent carbapenemase gene was bla(KPC-2) among Klebsiella
      pneumoniae (64.6%, 457/709) and the CRE strains isolated from adult
      patients (70.3%, 307/437), and bla(NDM) among Escherichia coli (96.0%,
      143/149) and the CRE strains from children (49.0%, 247/498). The
      bla(OXA-232)-positive carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (9.3%, 66/709)
      were all isolated from children. Sixteen strains were positive for
      bla(IMP) and 9 strains produced multiple carbapenemases. No strain was
      positive for bla(VIM). Most of the CRE strains (>90%) were resistant to
      cephalosporins and carbapenems, more than half (>50%) were resistant to
      aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones, but the majority (95.8 and 98.4%)
      were susceptible to polymyxin B and tigecycline. Ceftazidime-avibactam
      showed excellent in vitro activity against bla(KPC-2) and bla(OXA-48-like)
      positive strains (100% susceptible). In China, KPC-2, NDM, and OXA-48-like
      carbapenemases were predominant among CRE clinical isolates. The most
      prevalent carbapenemase gene was bla(KPC-2) among K. pneumoniae isolates
      from adult patients, and bla(NDM) among E. coli isolates from children.

AB  - The emergence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) has become a
      major public health concern. Moreover, its colonization among residents of
      long-term care facilities (LTCFs) is associated with subsequent infections
      and mortality. To further explore the various aspects concerning CRE in
      LTCFs, we conducted a literature review on CRE colonization and/or
      infections in long-term care facilities. The prevalence and incidence of
      CRE acquisition among residents of LTCFs, especially in California,
      central Italy, Spain, Japan, and Taiwan, were determined. There was a
      significant predominance of CRE in LTCFs, especially in high-acuity LTCFs
      with mechanical ventilation, and thus may serve as outbreak centers. The
      prevalence rate of CRE in LTCFs was significantly higher than that in
      acute care settings and the community, which indicated that LTCFs are a
      vital reservoir for CRE. The detailed species and genomic analyses of CRE
      among LTCFs reported that Klebsiella pneumoniae is the primary species in
      the LTCFs in the United States, Spain, and Taiwan. KPC-2-containing K.
      pneumoniae strains with sequence type 258 is the most common sequence type
      of KPC-producing K. pneumoniae in the LTCFs in the United States. IMP-11-
      and IMP-6-producing CRE were commonly reported among LTCFs in Japan.
      OXA-48 was the predominant carbapenemase among LTCFs in Spain. Multiple
      risk factors associated with the increased risk for CRE acquisition in
      LTCFs were found, such as comorbidities, immunosuppressive status,
      dependent functional status, usage of gastrointestinal devices or
      indwelling catheters, mechanical ventilation, prior antibiotic exposures,
      and previous culture reports. A high CRE acquisition rate and prolonged
      CRE carriage duration after colonization were found among residents in
      LTCFs. Moreover, the patients from LTCFs who were colonized or infected
      with CRE had poor clinical outcomes, with a mortality rate of up to 75% in
      infected patients. Infection prevention and control measures to reduce CRE
      in LTCFs is important, and could possibly be controlled via active
      surveillance, contact precautions, cohort staffing, daily chlorhexidine
      bathing, healthcare-worker education, and hand-hygiene adherence.

AB  - We describe in vivo evolution of carbapenem and ceftazidime-avibactam
      resistance by analyzing four longitudinal Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical
      isolates from a patient with pneumonia following antimicrobial treatment.
      The patient had fever, cough associated with expectoration, and new
      infiltration was found on the chest CT. Antimicrobial susceptibility was
      determined, and whole genome sequencing (WGS) was performed to investigate
      its dynamic change of resistance phenotype. Population analysis profile
      was performed to investigate the population of Klebsiella pneumoniae. The
      infection started with a KPC-2-producing K. pneumoniae (ZRKP01,
      ceftazidime-avibactam-S/carbapenem-R). Then, after ceftazidime-avibactam
      treatment, the strain switched to D179Y mutant that is KPC-33 (ZRKP02,
      ceftazidime-avibactam-R/carbapenem-S), which restored carbapenem
      susceptibility. However, the restored carbapenem susceptibility in vivo
      was not stable and the subsequent use of imipenem against KPC-33-producing
      K. pneumoniae infection resulted in a reversion of KPC-2 producers (ZRKP03
      and ZRKP04, ceftazidime-avibactam-S/carbapenem-R). Genetic analysis
      demonstrated that all four K. pneumoniae isolates belonged to sequence
      type 11and had identical capsular polysaccharide (KL47), identical porin
      genes, and same plasmid replicon types. Phylogenetic analysis indicated
      that four K. pneumoniae isolates showed a high degree of relatedness.
      Single nucleotide polymorphisms analysis indicated that the number of
      mutations observed in the KPC-33 isolate was more than in the wild-type
      KPC-2 isolates and the four KPC-Kp isolates evolved from a longitudinal
      evolution of K. pneumoniae harboring bla (KPC-2) gene. This is the first
      report to observe the in vivo evolution of wild-type KPC-2 to KPC-33 and
      then the reversion to its original wild-type KPC-2. Through WGS, we
      demonstrated the role of selective pressure of antibiotic in the mutation
      and reversion of bla (KPC) genes, which leading to the dynamic change of
      KPC enzymes and the dynamic emergence of resistance to
      ceftazidime-avibactam and carbapenems. Statement: Recently, studies
      reported the emergence of ceftazidime-avibactam-resistant strains. The KPC
      mutations mediating ceftazidime-avibactam resistance are generally
      associated with the restoration of carbapenem susceptibility. However,
      clinical significance of this observation is unclear. In this manuscript,
      we demonstrate the role of selective pressure of antibiotic in the
      mutation and reversion of bla (KPC) genes, which leading to the dynamic
      change of KPC enzymes and the dynamic emergence of resistance to
      ceftazidime-avibactam and carbapenems. To the best of our knowledge, this
      is the first report to observe the in vivo evolution of wild-type KPC-2 to
      KPC-33 and then the reversion to its original wild-type KPC-2. It should
      be noted that understanding the clinical significance of this observation
      is of critical importance, and reversion to carbapenem susceptibility
      would not imply a potential role for carbapenems monotherapy. We hope our
      study will draw attention to clinicians, so that this agent can be used
      most effectively for the longest period of time.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Carbapenems are frequently used in the treatment of
      multidrug-resistant infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae. The aim of
      the study is to definition and incidence of transferable carbapenemase
      genes of carbapenem resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP) and to determine clonal
      relatedness of these strains in tertiary care hospital in Turkey. METHODS:
      Identification of all 100 K. pneumoniae isolates and low sensitivity to
      any of the carbapenem group antibiotics were determined by Vitek-2
      (BioMérieux, France). The frequency of carbapenemase genes (bla(OXA-48),
      bla(NDM), bla(KPC), bla(VIM,)bla(IMP)) and extended spectrum
      beta-lactamase (ESBL) genes (bla(CTX-M), bla(SHV), bla(TEM)) which
      frequently detected in Turkey, have been investigated by multiplex
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Clonal relatedness was determined using
      Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis(PFGE). RESULTS: Ninety five isolates
      carried at least one of the carbapenemase genes (81.05% bla(OXA-48), 38.9%
      bla(NDM), 9.47% bla(KPC),1.05% bla(VIM)). One isolate was carried the
      bla(OXA-48+KPC) and the two isolates were carried the bla(KPC+NDM). PFGE
      demonstrated the presence of 24 pulse types and 63.09% of the isolates
      were in four main pulse types. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the
      incidence of bla(NDM) is beginning to reach endemic levels, in addition to
      bla(OXA-48) found endemic in Turkey. To our knowledge, this is the first
      report of the co-production of these two genes (bla(KPC + NDM) and
      bla(OXA-48 + KPC)) in CRKP isolates.

AB  - From January 2019 to April 2020, 32 KPC-producing, ceftazidime-avibactam
      (CZA)-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strains were isolated in a
      university hospital in Rome, Italy. These strains belonged to the sequence
      type 512 (ST512), ST101, and ST307 high-risk clones. Nine different
      CZA-resistant KPC-3 protein variants were identified, five of them never
      previously reported (KPC-66 to KPC-70). Among the nine, KPC-31, KPC-39,
      KPC-49, KPC-66, KP-68, KPC-69, and KPC-70 showed amino acid substitutions,
      insertions, and deletions in the Ω loop of the protein. KPC-29 has a
      duplication, while the novel KPC-67 has a triplication, of the KDD triplet
      in the 270-loop, a secondary loop of the KPC-3 protein. Genomics performed
      on contemporary resistant and susceptible clones underlined that these
      novel mutations emerged in bla(KPC-3) genes located on conserved plasmids:
      in ST512, all bla(KPC-3) mutant genes were located in pKpQIL plasmids,
      while the three novel bla(KPC-3) mutants identified in ST101 were on
      FIIk-FIA(HI1)-R plasmids. Selection also promoted multiplication of the
      carbapenemase gene copy number by transposition, recombination, and fusion
      of resident plasmids. When expressed in Escherichia coli recipient cells
      cloned in the high-copy-number pTOPO vector, the Ω loop mutated variants
      showed the CZA-resistant phenotype associated with susceptibility to
      carbapenems, while KPC variants with insertions in the 270-loop showed
      residual activity on carbapenems. The investigation of CZA resistance
      mechanisms offered the unique opportunity to study vertical, horizontal,
      and oblique evolutionary trajectories of K. pneumoniae high-risk clones.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Optimal treatment of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales
      (CPE) bone infections is poorly defined. This study evaluated the efficacy
      of the novel beta-lactam-beta-lactamase inhibitor-ceftazidime-avibactam
      (CAZ-AVI)-with different antibiotic combinations in an experimental model
      of CPE osteomyelitis. METHODS: KPC-99YC is a clinical strain of Klebsiella
      pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae with
      intermediate susceptibility to meropenem (MIC 4 mg/L), gentamicin (MIC
      0.25 mg/L), colistin (MIC 0.25 mg/L), fosfomycin (MIC 4 mg/L) and
      ceftazidime-avibactam (MIC 1 mg/L). Time-kill curves were performed at 4x
      MIC. Osteomyelitis was induced in rabbits by tibial injection of 2×10(8)
      CFU of KPC-99YC. Six groups started treatment 14 days later for 7 days:
      control, colistin, CAZ-AVI, CAZ-AVI plus gentamicin, CAZ-AVI plus colistin
      and CAZ-AVI plus fosfomycin. Antibiotic dosages were selected to simulate
      plasma concentrations obtained in humans. Treatment was evaluated
      according to bone cultures quantified in log(10) CFU. RESULTS: In vitro,
      CAZ-AVI plus colistin or gentamicin were rapidly bactericidal in contrast
      with CAZ-AVI plus fosfomycin. In vivo, compared with controls, colistin
      alone (P = 0.045) and CAZ-AVI alone or in combination significantly
      lowered bone bacterial counts (P < 0.001). Bone sterilisation was achieved
      in 67% and 100% of animals with combinations of CAZ-AVI plus colistin or
      gentamicin (P = 0.001 and P < 0.001, respectively) whereas other
      treatments were no different from controls. CAZ-AVI plus gentamicin
      provided greater bone bacterial reduction than CAZ-AVI plus colistin (P =
      0.033). No CAZ-AVI-resistant strains emerged in treated rabbits,
      regardless of combination. CONCLUSIONS: CAZ-AVI plus gentamicin was the
      best effective combination therapy. Combinations with CAZ-AVI appear to be
      a promising treatment of KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae
      osteomyelitis.

AB  - Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPEs) strains represent a
      serious threat to public health. The rapid diffusion of CPEs is of
      particular concern due to the limited effective treatments available
      against these multidrug resistant microorganisms. In this study, we
      characterized the complete genome sequence of Klebsiella pneumoniae strain
      BO714 coproducing KPC and OXA-181 carbapenemase conferring resistance to
      all β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations (βL-βLICs) and siderophore
      cephalosporin cefiderocol (CFD). The genome of BO714 has a length of
      5,876,068 bp with an average G + C content of 56.96% and a total of 5,878
      open reading frames. The KPC-Kp strain BO714 was classified as ST512 and
      contained a circular chromosome of 5,348,787 bp and three different
      plasmids, respectively, of 363,560, 112,243, and 51,478 bp. Resistome
      analysis showed that BO714 harbored different β-lactamase genes including
      bla(CMY-16), bla(OXA-10), bla(TEM-1), bla(SHV-11), bla(OXA181), and a
      novel bla(KPC-3) variant named bla(KPC-125). KPC-125 differed to KPC-3 by
      Asp to Ala at position 179 within the Ω-loop region. The genomic
      characterization of a K. pneumoniae cross-resistant to novel βL-βLICs and
      CFD improves knowledge regarding the emergence of novel traits of
      multidrug resistance in CPEs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K.
      pneumoniae (KPC-KP) has spread worldwide and has become a major threat to
      public health. The restriction modification system provides an innate
      defence of bacteria against plasmids or transposons, while many different
      types of plasmid encoding the anti-restriction protein ArdA can
      specifically affect the restriction activity in bacteria. OBJECTIVES: To
      detect the codistribution of ArdA and blaKPC-2 plasmids in KPC-KP and
      explore the molecular mechanism of ArdA promoting KPC-KP spread. METHODS:
      We collected 65 clinical CRKP isolates from Ningbo, China, and 68 cases of
      plasmid complete sequences in GenBank to determine the prevalence of ArdA
      gene on the K. pneumoniae blaKPC-2 plasmid. The anti-restriction function
      of ArdA in promoting horizontal gene transfer (HGT) was verified by
      transformation, conjugation and transduction methods, and the pull-down
      experiment was used to investigate the molecular mechanism of ArdA protein
      in vitro. RESULTS: We found that ArdA was widely distributed in KPC-KP in
      100% of cases, which was detected in 0% of drug susceptible K. pneumoniae,
      and the plasmids containing the ArdA gene in 90% of the 30 cases randomly
      retrieved from the database. We also verified that ArdA has a good
      anti-restriction function (P < 0.05) through two aspects of HGT
      (transformation, transduction), and explored the non-occurrence
      interaction of ArdA and the hsdM subunit protein of EcoKI enzyme from the
      perspective of protein molecules. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that
      the coexistence advantage of ArdA with the blaKPC-2 plasmids may provide
      KPC-producing K. pneumoniae with a very efficient evasion of the
      restriction of type I systems, which not only favours ArdA-containing
      mobile genetic elements in the same species HGT between bacteria also
      facilitates HGT between other bacterial species.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae (KPC-Kp)
      represent a serious threat to public health and their timely detection is
      essential for patient management and the prevention of nosocomial
      infections. Here, matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization
      time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was used to rapidly
      identify dominant KPC-Kp in China, by using an automated detection of a
      KPC-specific peak (at 4521 m/z) by a genetic algorithm using ClinProTools
      software. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was used to understand the genetic
      environment of the bla(KPC-2) gene. In this study, we analyzed 235 K.
      pneumoniae Chinese clinical isolates, of which 175 (93 KPC-positive
      isolates and 82 KPC-negative isolates) isolates were used to build a model
      to select a KPC-specific peak, and another 60 isolates for external
      validation. In addition, all the spectra were visually inspected by the
      FlexAnalysis software to evaluate the accuracy of the automated detection.
      The results showed a 4521 m/z peak found in all bla(KPC-2)-positive
      isolates but absent in bla(KPC-2)-negative isolates. Interestingly, all
      KPC-Kp belonged to ST11, the dominant clone in China. WGS analysis of a
      representative isolate showed that the genetic environment of KPC-2 was
      IS26-ISKpn27-bla(KPC-2)-ΔISKpn6-Tn1721, similar to the KPC-2 genetic
      environment of ST11 KPC-Kp previously reported in China. Therefore, the
      4521 m/z peak is closely related to ST11 KPC-Kp. In summary, we used
      MALDI-TOF MS to quickly detect KPC-Kp in the process of routine bacterial
      identification without increasing costs or requiring further knowledge,
      which has broad application prospects in drug resistance analysis and
      infection control.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This study was designed to characterize the dissemination
      mechanism and genetic context of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)
      genes in carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) isolates.
      METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed on CRKP strains isolated
      from a teaching hospital of Wenzhou Medical University during 2015-2017.
      Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based amplification and whole-genome
      sequencing (WGS) were used to analyze the genetic context of the bla
      (KPC-2) gene. Conjugation experiments were performed to evaluate the
      transferability of bla (KPC-2)-bearing plasmids. Multilocus sequence
      typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were performed
      to investigate the clonal relatedness of bla (KPC-2)-producing strains.
      RESULTS: The bla (KPC-2) gene was identified from 13.61% (40/294) of
      clinical K. pneumoniae isolates. Three different sequence types (ST11,
      ST15 and ST656) and 5 PFGE subtypes (A to E) were classified among them.
      ST11 was the dominant sequence type (92.50%, 37/40). Plasmid-oriented
      antibiotic resistance genes, such as extended spectrum-β-lactamases
      (ESBLs) and other antimicrobial resistance genes, were also found in
      KPC-positive K. pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) isolates. Mapping PCR and genomic
      sequencing revealed that the bla (KPC-2)-bearing sequence regions, which
      are related to different mobile elements, including Tn1721- and IS26-based
      transposons, were mainly located in but not restricted to IncFII-like
      plasmids and were structurally divergent. CONCLUSION: The bla (KPC-2)
      genes related to divergent mobile genetic elements encoded on transferable
      plasmids may transfer widely, facilitating the spread of carbapenem
      resistance among bacteria with different genetic backgrounds. The
      dissemination of bla (KPC)-bearing plasmids that collectively carry
      additional multidrug resistance genes has caused widespread public
      concern, further limiting the antibiotics available to treat infections
      caused by KPC-producing pathogens.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae (KPC-KP)
      have disseminated worldwide and are a major threat to public health. The
      multidrug-resistant (MDR)-phenotype of KPC-KP are commonly associated with
      the presence of high molecular weight bla(KPC) plasmids.
      Restriction-modification (R-M) systems provide bacteria with innate
      defense against plasmids or other infectious gene elements. As bla(KPC)
      plasmids are favored by such MDR K. pneumoniae, it was of interest to
      examine the co-distribution of R-M and acquired bla(KPC) plasmids in
      KPC-KP. A total of 459 clinical K. pneumoniae isolates in China and 217
      global whole-genome sequences in GenBank were collected to determine the
      prevalence of type I R-M systems. The type I R-M systems were scarce in
      the KPC-positive group and high-risk Klebsiella pneumoniae clonal group
      258 (CG258). The polymorphisms of type I R-M observed in K. pneumoniae
      revealed the ubiquity of their recognition sequences in DNA; therefore,
      the type I R-M systems could attack most invading DNA elements, such as
      bla(KPC) genes. Overall, this work indicated the type I R-M systems may
      impact the acquisition of bla(KPC) genes in K. pneumoniae.

      inhibitor combinations in a multi-clonal outbreak caused by Klebsiella

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales represent a major
      cause of difficult-to-treat infections world-wide. Novel
      β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations, including
      ceftazidime/avibactam (CZA), meropenem/vaborbactam (MVB), and
      imipenem/relebactam (IMR), represented a break-through in the treatment of
      some carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales infections. However,
      acquired resistance to these agents has been reported in Klebsiella
      pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Enterobacterales. Herein, we
      reported an outbreak caused by CZA-resistant, KPC-producing Klebsiella
      pneumoniae (KPC-Kp), which was also variably resistant to carbapenem-based
      β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations. METHODS: Bacterial isolates
      were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, whole-genome
      sequencing, determination of bla(KPC) gene dosage, and analysis of
      carbapenemase activity. RESULTS: Overall, 15 KPC-Kp, nine CZA-resistant
      (CZA(R)), and six CZA-susceptible isolates were collected from an outbreak
      involving six patients in a neurorehabilitation facility. Of the nine
      CZA(R) isolates, seven were also resistant to MVB and one was also
      resistant to IMR. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that the outbreak was
      multi-clonal, with CZA(R) KPC-Kp belonging to the ST101, ST1519, and two
      ST512 sub-lineages, which were involved in two independent transmission
      clusters. Resistance to CZA was primarily mediated by overproduction of
      KPC-3 associated with increased gene dosage, a mechanism accounting for
      cross-resistance to MVB in most cases, and to IMR in a single KPC-Kp
      isolate; multiple OmpK36 aletarions were also detected. Mutated KPC
      (KPC-53) was detected in a single case. Positivity for CZA(R) KPC-Kp was
      inconstantly associated with previous CZA exposure. CONCLUSIONS: In this
      multi-clonal outbreak of KPC-Kp, the overproduction of KPC-3 was the
      leading mechanism of cross-resistance to CZA and MVB, whereas resistance
      to IMR appeared less affected. The emergence and dissemination of similar
      resistance mechanisms may have relevant clinical and diagnostic
      implications, and their surveillance is warranted.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) is an important pathogen causing
      various types of human infections in Taiwan. Carbapenemases have
      increasingly been reported in Enterobacterales in the past two decades.
      Carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae (CPKP), a major resistance concern
      that has emerged during the last decade, has become a global threat, with
      its related infections associated with high morbidity and mortality;
      however, therapeutic options for CPKP-associated infections are limited.
      Carbapenemases - including K. pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPC)-2, New Delhi
      metallo-β-lactamase (NDM)-1, Verona integron-encoded metallo-β-lactamase
      (VIM)-1, imipenemase (IMP)-1, and oxacillinase (OXA)-48 - have been
      reported worldwide, with a marked prevalence in different countries or
      areas of the world. Understanding the epidemiology of carbapenemase
      producers is important for the prevention of their expansion. This review
      examined the evolution of CPKP in the last two decades to better
      understand the role of CPKP in Taiwan. It discovered that the endemicity
      has changed from IMP-8, NDM-1 and VIM-1 to the most common KPC-2 and
      rapidly emerging OXA-48. Resistance epidemiology, genetic background,
      virulence factors, therapy, and outcomes are discussed in this paper.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To characterize carbapenemase-producing isolates of the
      Klebsiella pneumoniae hypervirulent (hvKp) clone ST23 in Poland. METHODS:
      Fifteen K. pneumoniae ST23 isolates were identified by the Polish
      surveillance of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales. These comprised
      a cluster with KPC-2 + NDM-1 (n = 7), KPC-2 (n = 1) or NDM-1 (n = 1)
      enzymes from one hospital from 2018, and sporadic isolates with KPC-2 (n =
      1), NDM-1 (n = 1), VIM-1 (n = 1) or OXA-48 (n = 3), recovered from 2009 to
      2019 in different towns. The isolates were sequenced by Illumina MiSeq,
      followed by MinION for six representatives. Clonality, phylogeny,
      serotypes, virulomes, resistomes and plasmids of the isolates were
      analysed and compared with international ST23 strains, using various
      bioinformatic tools. RESULTS: Only two diverse isolates with KPC-2 or
      VIM-1 were of typical hvKp ST23 serotypes K1 and O1v.2, and its
      predominant phylogenetic clade. These contained multiple chromosomal (ybt,
      clb) and pK2044/KpVP-1 plasmid (iuc, iro, rmpADC, rmpA2) virulence loci,
      whereas carbapenemase and other antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes were
      on single additional plasmids. All remaining isolates were of K57 and
      O2v.2 serotypes, and a minor, distant clade of unclear phylogeny,
      including also ∼10 isolates from other European countries. These had fewer
      virulence loci (ybt, iuc, rmpADC, rmpA2) but abounded in plasmids, which
      with several chromosomal AMR mutations conferred more extensive MDR
      phenotypes than in K1 O1v.2. Lower clonal diversity than in K1, and
      numerous common characteristics of the isolates supported the hypothesis
      of the emerging character of the ST23 K57 clade. CONCLUSIONS: A new MDR
      ST23 lineage has emerged in Europe, causing a potential threat to public
      health.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the inhibitory effect of Lactobacillus
      spp. with prebiotics against Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-2
      (KPC-2)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae using both in vitro experiments
      and animal models. METHODS: Thirty-three Lactobacillus spp. strains were
      confirmed by 16S rDNA sequencing, and four different PFGE genotyped
      KPC-2-producing K. pneumoniae strains were selected for investigation. In
      vitro studies, including broth microdilution assays, changes in pH values
      in lactobacilli cultures with different prebiotics, time-kill tests of
      Lactobacillus spp. against KPC-2-producing K. pneumoniae and further in
      vivo Lactobacillus alone or in combination with prebiotics against
      KPC-2-producing K. pneumoniae in an animal model, were performed. RESULTS:
      The lower pH value of the cell-free supernatant was associated with a
      lower minimal inhibitory percentage of the Lactobacillus strain against
      KPC-2-producing K. pneumoniae. Furthermore,
      lactulose/isomalto-oligosaccharide/inulin and fructo-oligosaccharide can
      enhance the inhibitory effect of all 10(7) CFU/ml Lactobacillus strains
      against KPC001. Three Lactobacillus strains (LYC1154, LYC1322, and
      LYC1511) that could be persistently detected in the stool were tested for
      their ability to reduce the amount of KPC001 in the feces individually or
      in combination. A significantly better effect in reducing the amount of
      KPC001 was observed for the combination of three different Lactobacillus
      species than for each of them alone. Furthermore, their inhibitory effect
      was enhanced after adding lactulose or isomalto-oligosaccharide (both p <
      0.05). CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates the inhibitory effect of
      probiotic Lactobacillus, including LYC1154, LYC1322, and LYC1511, with
      prebiotics such as lactulose or isomalto-oligosaccharide against the
      colonization of KPC-2-producing K. pneumoniae.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The study objective of this analysis was to determine the
      cost-effectiveness of vaborem (meropenem-vaborbactam) compared to the best
      available therapy (BAT) in adult patients with carbapenem-resistant
      Enterobacteriaceae-Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (CRE-KPC)
      infections from the perspective of the UK National Health Service (NHS)
      and Personal Social Services (PSS). METHODS: A decision tree model was
      developed to conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis for Vaborem compared to
      BAT in CRE-KPC patients over a 5 year time horizon. The model structure
      for Vaborem simulated the clinical pathway of patients with a confirmed
      CRE-KPC infection. Model inputs for clinical effectiveness were sourced
      from the TANGO II trial, and published literature. Costs, resource use and
      utility values associated with CRE-KPC infections in the UK were sourced
      from the British National Formulary, NHS reference costs and published
      sources. RESULTS: Over a 5 year time horizon, Vaborem use increased total
      costs by £5165 and increased quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) by 0.366,
      resulting in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of £14,113 per
      QALY gained. The ICER was most sensitive to the probability of discharge
      to long-term care (LTC), the annual cost of LTC and the utility of
      discharge to home. At thresholds of £20,000/QALY and £30,000/QALY, the
      probability of Vaborem being cost-effective compared to BAT was 79.85% and
      94.93%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Due to a limited cost impact and
      increase in patient quality of life, vaborem can be considered as a
      cost-effective treatment option compared to BAT for adult patients with
      CRE-KPC infections in the UK.

AB  - Ceftazidime-avibactam is an effective antibiotic combination of a β-lactam
      and a β-lactamase inhibitor against Klebsiella pneumoniae-carbapenemase
      (KPC)-producing Enterobacterales. Despite a relatively low resistance
      rate, reports of resistance to ceftazidime-avibactam mainly caused by the
      mutations in KPC have increased in recent years. Here, we report a
      ceftazidime-avibactam-resistant and carbapenem-susceptible Klebsiella
      pneumoniae strain carrying a novel KPC variant, KPC-112, which differs
      from KPC-2 by 4-amino-acid deletions at Ambler positions 166L/167E and
      242G/243T. The isolate was identified as K. pneumoniae by a Vitek mass
      spectrometer (bioMérieux, France). The MICs of antimicrobial agents were
      determined using broth microdilution susceptibility method. The result
      showed that the isolate was resistant to ceftazidime-avibactam (MIC = >128
      mg/L) but susceptible to imipenem (MIC = 0.5 mg/L), meropenem (MIC = 1
      mg/L), and tigecycline (MIC = 2 mg/L). The carbapenemase genes were
      confirmed by PCR-based sequencing. Plasmid transformation assay showed
      that the bla(KPC-112)-positive transformant increased MICs of
      ceftazidime-avibactam, ceftazidime, and cefepime by at least 256-fold,
      128-fold, and 128-fold, respectively, compared with the recipient
      Escherichia coli DH5α. According to the whole-genome sequencing analysis,
      many common resistance genes were identified, including bla(KPC-112),
      bla(OXA-1), bla(CTX-M-15), bla(TEM-1B), bla(SHV-28), aac(6')Ib-cr,
      aac(3)-IId, qnrS1, catA2, catB4, and fosA6, and mutations of GyrA
      (GyrA-83F and GyrA-87A) and ParC (ParC-80I) were also found. Overall, our
      study highlights the importance of monitoring susceptibility during
      ceftazidime-avibactam treatment and accurate detection of KPC variants.
      IMPORTANCE Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) are one of the most
      serious antimicrobial resistance problems in the world, listed as an
      "urgent" threat by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
      Among CRE, K. pneumoniae-carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae
      (KPC-KP) has become a significant health threat due to its rapid
      transmissibility and high mortality. With the wider clinical use of
      ceftazidime-avibactam, reports of resistance have increased in recent
      years even though the overall resistance rate remains relatively low.
      Among the reported resistance mechanisms are mainly mutations derived from
      the bla(KPC-2) or bla(KPC-3) gene. Here, we describe the characterization
      of a ceftazidime-avibactam-resistant bla(KPC-112)-positive K. pneumoniae
      clinical isolate for the first time. A number of Enterobacteriaceae
      isolates producing these kinds of KPC variants might be missed by
      conventional antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) methods and lead
      to irrational drug use. So, this study of KPC-112 will help to establish
      the diversity of KPCs and remind researchers of the challenge of drug
      resistance and detection brought by the KPC variants.

AB  - Aim: Infections by Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K.
      pneumoniae represent a major challenge because of limited treatment
      strategies. New β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor associations may help to
      deal with this challenge. The aim of this study is to evaluate the in
      vitro susceptibility of KPC-producing K. pneumoniae for
      meropenem/vaborbactam in comparison with ceftazidime/avibactam against.
      Materials and methods: Twenty-eight strains isolated from blood cultures
      were evaluated. Testing for susceptibility to meropenem/vaborbactam and
      ceftazidime/avibactam was performed by E-test gradient strip. Results: All
      the clinical isolates were susceptible to meropenem/vaborbactam, while one
      strain was resistant to ceftazidime/avibactam with a MIC of 32 μg/ml. The
      median MIC of ceftazidime/avibactam evaluated after standardization was
      higher compared with that of meropenem/vaborbactam. Conclusion:
      Meropenem/vaborbactam could be an important turning point in the treatment
      of KPC-producing K. pneumoniae infections, especially considering the
      emergence of ceftazidime/avibactam resistance.

AB  - Gram-negative bacteria containing three different carbapenemases are
      extremely rare. Klebsiella pneumoniae (N22-925) with KPC-2, NDM-1, and
      OXA-48 was obtained from a Canadian patient with recent hospitalization in
      Romania. Short and long read whole genome sequencing showed that the
      bla(KPC-2) was situated on a 214 kb IncFIB(K)/IncFII(K) plasmid, the
      bla(NDM-1) on a 104 kb IncFIB (pQil)/IncFII(K) plasmid, and the
      bla(OXA-48) on a 64 kb IncL plasmid. These plasmids were conjugated to
      Escherichia coli J53. N22-925 belonged to a unique ST147 cluster that is
      likely endemic in Romania. This case emphasizes the need for rapid
      carbapenemase screening in patients from endemic regions. We described the
      first complete genome sequence of a K. pneumoniae isolate with three
      different carbapenemases, providing a reference for future studies on this
      rarely reported occurrence.

      tigecycline alone or in combination for experimental infections by KPC-Kp.
      A total of 540 male C57BL/6 mice were infected with three genetically
      diverse KPC-Kp isolates susceptible to tigecycline with meropenem minimum
      inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 4, 16 and 256 μg/mL, respectively.
      Mice were randomly treated with water for injection, tigecycline,
      meropenem and colistin alone, and double or triple combinations of
      tigecycline, colistin and meropenem. Mouse survival was recorded for 14
      days. In separate experiments, mice were sacrificed 6 h and 24 h after
      bacterial challenge for quantitative culture of tissues and serological
      analysis. Time-kill curves were performed. Tigecycline, colistin and
      meropenem concentrations were measured in tissues and serum by
      high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Survival was significantly
      prolonged when mice were treated with tigecycline alone and
      tigecycline-containing regimens compared with control mice and mice
      treated with tigecycline-sparing regimens. Tigecycline-sparing regimens
      were active only against the isolate with a meropenem MIC of 4 μg/mL.
      Mortality was associated with progression to multiple organ failure.
      Tigecycline and tigecycline-containing regimens achieved a rapid decrease
      of bacterial loads both in tissues and in vitro. Tigecycline
      concentrations in tissues were negatively correlated with tissue bacterial
      load. Tigecycline alone or in combination with meropenem and/or colistin
      achieves effective treatment of experimental KPC-Kp infections
      irrespective of the meropenem MIC.

AB  - A novel Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) variant, KPC-55,
      produced by a K. pneumoniae ST307 strain was characterized. K. pneumoniae
      strain BS407 was recovered from an active surveillance rectal swab of a
      patient newly admitted to a general hospital in Busan, South Korea.
      Carbapenemase production was confirmed by the modified Hodge test, and the
      MICs of β-lactams were determined by the broth microdilution method. The
      whole genome was sequenced. Cloning and expression of the bla (KPC-55)
      gene in Escherichia coli and MIC determination were performed. The enzyme
      KPC-55 was used for kinetic assays against β-lactams and compared with the
      KPC-2 enzyme. The new allele of the bla (KPC) gene had a T794A alteration
      compared to the bla (KPC-2) gene, resulting in the amino acid substitution
      Y264N in the middle of the β9-sheet. Compared to the KPC-2-producing
      strain, the KPC-55-producing strain exhibited a lower level of resistance
      to most β-lactam drugs tested, however, the KPC-55 enzyme catalyzed
      aztreonam and meropenem at an increased efficiency compared to the
      catalytic activity of KPC-2. KPC subtypes could have varied phenotypes due
      to alterations in amino acid sequences, and such an unexpected resistance
      phenotype emphasizes the importance of detailed characterizations for the
      carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales.

AB  - Ceftazidime/avibactam (CZA) is used to treat infections caused by
      Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae (KPC-Kp).
      Resistance to CZA is commonly related to point mutations in the bla(KPC)
      gene. Here we describe the in vivo emergence of CZA resistance in clinical
      isolates of KPC-Kp from four patients treated with this combination
      therapy. Four pre-therapy and five post-therapy KPC-Kp isolates were
      examined. Antibiogram (microdilution and gradient strips) and whole-genome
      sequencing were performed. The role of KPC mutations was validated by
      cloning bla(KPC) genes into competent Escherichia coli. All KPC-Kp
      isolates recovered before treatment with CZA were susceptible to CZA and
      produced KPC-3. Five KPC-Kp isolates recovered after treatment were
      resistant to this combination. Three post-therapy isolates from two
      patients produced KPC-31 (D179Y mutation). Additionally, we identified the
      novel substitution LN169-170H (KPC-94) in one isolate, and the combination
      of two independently described mutations, D179Y and A172T (KPC-95), in
      another isolate. All KPC-Kp isolates belonged to sequence type 512
      (ST512). All CZA-resistant isolates with bla(KPC) variants had restoration
      of carbapenem susceptibility. In conclusion, resistance to CZA was related
      to bla(KPC) mutations, including the new KPC-94 and KPC-95 alleles, which
      do not cause carbapenem resistance.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) causes
      life-threatening hospital-acquired infections. KPC and VIM carbapenemase
      production is the main molecular mechanism for carbapenem resistance. The
      aim of the current study was the genetic characterization of four ST39
      CRKP isolates simultaneously producing VIM-1 and KPC-2, obtained in a
      Greek tertiary hospital. METHODS: Identification and antimicrobial
      susceptibility testing were performed through VITEK 2. Multiplex PCR,
      multiplex lateral flow immunoassay, phenotypic tests and next generation
      sequencing were applied. The sequence reads were de novo assembled and
      annotated, while antimicrobial resistance genes and plasmids were
      identified using bioinformatics software. Genomic comparison and core
      genome single-nucleotide polymorphism-based phylogenetic analysis were
      also performed. RESULTS: Three isolates were pandrug-resistant, and one
      was extensively drug-resistant; they all carried bla(VIM-1) and bla(KPC-2)
      genes and were assigned to ST39. Bla(VIM-1) was integrated in a class 1
      integron. They all harboured many antimicrobial resistance genes and
      various plasmids. The mgrB gene of all isolates was disrupted by an
      insertion sequence (ISKpn14). Genome comparison and phylogenetic analysis
      revealed that the isolates were closely related. CONCLUSION: To our
      knowledge this is the first report on detection of CRKP ST39 isolates
      simultaneously producing VIM-1 and KPC-2 in addition to colistin
      resistance. The knowledge of the clonal relatedness of the isolates can
      lead to the implementation of strict infection control measures absolutely
      needed to eliminate their spread.

AB  - Several Klebsiella pneumoniae carpabenemase (KPC) gene mutations are
      associated with ceftazidime/avibactam (CAZ-AVI) resistance. Here, we
      describe four Klebsiella pneumoniae subsp. pneumoniae CAZ-AVI-resistant
      clinical isolates, collected at the University Hospital of Tor Vergata,
      Rome, Italy, from July 2019 to February 2020. These resistant strains were
      characterized as KPC-3, having the transition from cytosine to thymine
      (CAC-TAC) at nucleotide position 814, with histidine that replaces
      tyrosine (H272Y). In addition, two different types of KPC gene mutations
      were detected. The first one, common to three strains, was the D179Y
      (G532T), associated with CAZ-AVI resistance. The second mutation, found
      only in one strain, is a new mutation of the KPC-3 gene: a transversion
      from thymine to adenine (CTG-CAG) at nucleotide position 553. This
      mutation causes a KPC variant in which glutamine replaces leucine (Q168L).
      None of the isolates were detected by a rapid immunochromatographic assay
      for detection of carbapenemase (NG Biotech, Guipry, France) and were
      unable to grow on a selective chromogenic medium Carba SMART (bioMerieux,
      Firenze, Italy). Thus, they escaped common tests used for the prompt
      detection of Klebsiella pneumoniae KPC-producing.

      different dosing regimens of ceftazidime/avibactam (CZA) in patients with
      Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae (KPC-Kp)
      pulmonary infections. METHODS: A total of 70 KPC-Kp strains were isolated
      from sputum and bronchoalveolar lavage samples of patients with pulmonary
      infections in three hospitals in northern China from April 2015 to October
      2015. Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) was performed using population
      pharmacokinetic parameters of CZA combined with the minimum inhibitory
      concentration (MIC) distributions gained from antimicrobial susceptibility
      testing to predict the efficacy of different dosing regimens. Various CZA
      dosing regimens were modelled using MCS. RESULTS: The in vitro study
      showed potent activity of CZA against KPC-Kp strains with MIC(50/90)
      values of 1/2 mg/L, with a susceptibility rate of 95.7%. The values of
      cumulative fraction of response (CFR) for bactericidal (50%fT>5 × MIC)
      target were as follows: for patients with creatinine clearance (CL(Cr))
      >51 mL/min, the CFR was 96.01% for 2.5 g CZA every 12 h (q12h) and 97.14%
      for 2.5 g CZA every 8 h (q8h); and for patients with moderate renal
      impairment (CL(Cr) >30 to ≤50 mL/min), the CFR was 95.75% for 1.25 g CZA
      q12h and 97.09% for 1.25 g CZA q8h. CONCLUSION: This study indicated that
      the recommended dose of CZA can provide adequate pharmacodynamic exposure
      for treating KPC-Kp pneumonia.

AB  - Bovine mastitis, an inflammation of the mammary gland of dairy cattle, is
      the most prevalent disease causing economically important losses, reduced
      milk production, early culling, veterinary expenses, and higher death
      rates. Bovine mastitis infections are the main cause for the use of
      antibiotics; however, the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria and
      the poor or nil response to antibiotics has become a critical global
      health problem. The goal of this study was the characterization of
      bacterial infections associated with clinical bovine mastitis. All the
      isolates were multidrug-resistant and were negative for the production of
      extended spectrum β-lactamases. However, all isolates were identified as
      carbapenemase-producing organisms by the Carba NP test. The carbapenemase
      identified was the product of the KPC-2 gene. The isolates were identified
      as Klebsiella pneumoniae and contained virulence genes for fimbriae,
      lipopolysaccharides, nitrogen starvation genes, and siderophores.
      Sixty-nine percent of the KPC-2-producing isolates had the same plasmid
      profile, although the genetic mobilization of resistance by bacterial
      conjugation was unsuccessful. The carbapenemase corresponded to the
      plasmid-borne KPC-2 gene identified by Southern blot hybridization. The
      assay showed a positive signal in the 90 kb (69% of the isolates), 165 kb
      (31% of the isolates), and 130 kb (6% of the isolates) plasmids. The
      IncFII(y) and IncFII(k) replicons were detected among these K. pneumoniae
      isolates. The PFGE and MLST analysis showed that all of the isolates are
      comprised by two clones (A and B) belonging to Sequence Type 258. This is
      the first report of K. pneumoniae producing carbapenemase KPC-2 isolated
      from bovine mastitis.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: CARB-ES-19 is a comprehensive, multicenter, nationwide study
      integrating whole-genome sequencing (WGS) in the surveillance of
      carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae (CP-Kpn) and E. coli (CP-Eco) to
      determine their incidence, geographical distribution, phylogeny, and
      resistance mechanisms in Spain. METHODS: In total, 71 hospitals,
      representing all 50 Spanish provinces, collected the first 10 isolates per
      hospital (February to May 2019); CPE isolates were first identified
      according to EUCAST (meropenem MIC > 0.12 mg/L with immunochromatography,
      colorimetric tests, carbapenem inactivation, or carbapenem hydrolysis with
      MALDI-TOF). Prevalence and incidence were calculated according to
      population denominators. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed
      using the microdilution method (EUCAST). All 403 isolates collected were
      sequenced for high-resolution single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) typing,
      core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST), and resistome analysis.
      RESULTS: In total, 377 (93.5%) CP-Kpn and 26 (6.5%) CP-Eco isolates were
      collected from 62 (87.3%) hospitals in 46 (92%) provinces. CP-Kpn was more
      prevalent in the blood (5.8%, 50/853) than in the urine (1.4%,
      201/14,464). The cumulative incidence for both CP-Kpn and CP-Eco was 0.05
      per 100 admitted patients. The main carbapenemase genes identified in
      CP-Kpn were bla (OXA-48) (263/377), bla (KPC-3) (62/377), bla (VIM-1)
      (28/377), and bla (NDM-1) (12/377). All isolates were susceptible to at
      least two antibiotics. Interregional dissemination of eight high-risk
      CP-Kpn clones was detected, mainly ST307/OXA-48 (16.4%), ST11/OXA-48
      (16.4%), and ST512-ST258/KPC (13.8%). ST512/KPC and ST15/OXA-48 were the
      most frequent bacteremia-causative clones. The average number of acquired
      resistance genes was higher in CP-Kpn (7.9) than in CP-Eco (5.5).
      CONCLUSION: This study serves as a first step toward WGS integration in
      the surveillance of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales in Spain. We
      detected important epidemiological changes, including increased CP-Kpn and
      CP-Eco prevalence and incidence compared to previous studies, wide
      interregional dissemination, and increased dissemination of high-risk
      clones, such as ST307/OXA-48 and ST512/KPC-3.

      Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) are one of the most common CPE
      isolated from people but have been reported only rarely in animals. We
      characterized 2 KPC-producing Enterobacterales isolated from companion
      animal rectal swabs during the response to an outbreak caused by a strain
      of bla(NDM-5) Escherichia coli. Both isolates were characterized by
      whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and analysis. The first isolate (case A) was
      from an immunosuppressed 6-y-old Yorkshire Terrier and was identified as
      E. coli (ST372) with a bla(KPC-18) gene and an IncFII plasmid. The second
      isolate (case B) was from a 3-y-old Labrador Retriever with acute diarrhea
      and was identified as Citrobacter koseri with a bla(KPC-2) gene, multiple
      plasmids (ColRNAI, pKPC-CAV1193), and a putative enterotoxin gene (senB).
      Further research is needed to determine what role animals might play in
      the epidemiology of CPE in communities. It is imperative that all CPE
      isolated from companion animals be fully characterized by WGS and the
      associated case examined. All veterinary isolates should be sequenced and
      shared for surveillance, monitoring, and investigation purposes.

AB  - The convergence of hypervirulence to carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae
      (CRKP) in a highly transmissible ST11 clone poses a great challenge to
      public health and anti-infection therapy. Recently, we revealed that an
      expanding repertoire of diversified KPC-2-producing plasmids occurs in
      these high-risk clones. Here, we report a clinical case infected with a
      rare isolate of ST437 CRKP, K186, which exhibited KPC-2 production. Apart
      from its 5,322,657-bp long chromosome, whole-genome sequencing of strain
      K186 elucidated three distinct resistance plasmids (designated pK186_1,
      pK186_2, and pK186_KPC, respectively). Unlike the prevalently larger form
      of KPC-2-producing plasmids (~120 to ~170 kb) earlier we observed,
      pK186_KPC is an IncN-type, small plasmid of 26,012bp in length. Combined
      with the colinear alignment of plasmid genome, the analyses of insertion
      sequences further suggested that this carbapenem-resistant pK186_KPC might
      arise from the cointegration of its ancestral IncN and IncFII plasmids,
      exclusively relying on IS26-based transposition events. Taken together,
      the result represents an unusual example of bla(KPC-2)-bearing small
      plasmids, and highlights an ongoing arsenal of diversified carriers
      benefiting the transferability of KPC-2 carbapenem resistance. IMPORTANCE
      A rare ST437 isolate termed K186 was clinically determined which was
      unlike ST11, the dominant sequence type of CRKP. Whole-genome sequencing
      enabled us to discover three distinct resistance plasmids, namely,
      pK186_1, pK186_2, and pK186_KPC. Among them, pK186_KPC appears as a unique
      plasmid ~26 kb in size, much smaller than the prevalent forms (~120 to
      ~170 kb). Intriguingly, genetic analysis suggests that it might originate
      from Proteus mirabilis. This result constitutes an additional example of
      differentiated plasmid vehicles dedicated to the emergence and
      dissemination of KPC-2 carbapenem resistance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The spread of carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae
      (CP-Kp) strains belonging to high-risk sequence types (STs) is a concern.
      For Switzerland, national data about the molecular features (especially
      the STs) of CP-Kp of human origin is not available. In veterinary clinics,
      ST11 and ST307 bla(OXA-48)-possessing K. pneumoniae strains have been
      recently reported. METHODS: We analysed a collection of 285 K. pneumoniae
      genomes (170 were CP-Kp) isolated in Switzerland from human and non-human
      sources during 2006-2020. Whole-genome sequencing, core genome phylogenies
      and public databases were used to present a detailed overview regarding
      carbapenemases, STs and plasmids. RESULTS: The top five STs were (main
      carbapenemase gene) ST512 (bla(KPC-3)), ST258 (bla(KPC-2)) and ST101
      (bla(OXA-48)), consisting of strains of human origin only, and ST11
      (bla(OXA-48)) and ST307 (bla(OXA-48)) strains isolated from human, animal
      and environmental sources. However, during 2016-2020, the main STs for
      CP-Kp were ST11 (17.6%), ST307 and ST101 (both 14.7%), whereas ST258
      (5.9%) and ST512 (4.4%) significantly declined. Most carbapenemase genes
      were carried on plasmids already described. Core genome analysis revealed
      that ST11 K. pneumoniae of animal and human origin were closely related,
      whereas those of ST307 were distant. CONCLUSIONS: We described, for the
      first time, the features of the CP-Kp circulating in Switzerland in human
      and non-human settings. Our genomic analysis revealed that the emerging
      high-risk ST11 and ST307 lineages were often isolated from non-human
      settings. This study provided a baseline for further whole-genome
      sequencing-based One-Health surveillance of CP-Kp and emphasized the need
      for metadata to track dissemination routes between the different settings.

AB  - The evolutionary epidemiology, resistome, virulome and mobilome of
      thirty-one multidrug resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates
      from the northern Vila Real region of Portugal were characterized using
      whole-genome sequencing and bioinformatic analysis. The genomic population
      structure was dominated by two main sequence types (STs): ST147 (n = 17;
      54.8%) and ST15 (n = 6; 19.4%) comprising four distinct genomic clusters.
      Two main carbapenemase coding genes were detected (bla(KPC-3) and
      bla(OXA-48)) along with additional extended-spectrum β-lactamase coding
      loci (bla(CTX-M-15), bla(SHV-12), bla(SHV-27), and bla(SHV-187)).
      Moreover, whole genome sequencing enabled the identification of one
      Klebsiella variicola KPC-3 producer isolate previously misidentified as K.
      pneumoniae, which in addition to the bla(KPC-3) carbapenemase gene, bore
      the chromosomal broad spectrum β-lactamase bla(LEN-2) coding gene, oqxAB
      and fosA resistance loci. The bla(KPC-3) genes were located in a Tn4401b
      transposon (K. variicolan = 1; K. pneumoniaen = 2) and Tn4401d isoform (K.
      pneumoniaen = 28). Overall, our work describes the first report of a
      bla(KPC-3) producing K. variicola, as well as the detection of this
      species during infection control measures in surveillance cultures from
      infected patients. It also highlights the importance of additional control
      measures to overcome the clonal dissemination of carbapenemase producing
      clones.

AB  - Introduction. Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) is a major
      cause of clinical infection. However, K. pneumoniae carbapenemase
      (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae ST15 strains are occasionally identified and
      have seldom been reported to cause hospital outbreaks in PR
      China.Hypothesis/Gap Statement. In this study, we describe nosocomial
      outbreaks caused by KPC-producing K. pneumoniae ST15 strains in a Chinese
      tertiary hospital.Aim. To characterize the molecular relationship,
      resistance and virulence factors of the 32 KPC-producing K. pneumoniae
      ST15 strains isolated in a Chinese hospital.Methodology. A total of 102
      non-repetitive carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) strains were
      collected from a Chinese tertiary hospital in 2018. Multilocus sequence
      typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were performed
      to characterize the clonal relationship of the K. pneumoniae isolates, and
      the ST15 strains were selected for further study. Minimum inhibitory
      concentrations (MICs) were determined using the broth microdilution method
      and interpreted according to the Clinical and Laboratory Standards
      Institute (CLSI) guidelines. Fifteen carbapenem resistance genes, bla
      (KPC) genetic structures and 12 virulence factors were detected by PCR.
      Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed using next-generation
      sequencing combined with single-molecule real-time sequencing.Results.
      Thirty-two K. pneumoniae ST15 strains were characterized, and 31 of them
      presented a PFGE similarity of >92 %, indicating clonal spread. In 81.3 %
      (26/32) of strains, the imipenem (IPM) and meropenem (MEM) MICs were ≤8
      and≤16 µg ml(-1), while only 1 isolate (KP18069) exhibited ≥64 µg ml(-1)
      for both agents. The bla (KPC-2) gene embedded in the Tn3-Tn4401 chimaera
      and synonymous mutations of the ompK35 gene were detected in all the
      strains. However, a nonsense mutation at amino acid position 248 (K248X)
      of OmpK36 was found in the highly carbapenem-resistant strain KP18069. No
      virulence gene was detected in any of the ST15 strains. WGS analyses
      further confirmed the genetic characteristics of the K. pneumoniae KP18069
      strain.Conclusion. Nosocomial outbreaks caused by the clonal spread of K.
      pneumoniae ST15 strains were characterized in a Chinese tertiary hospital,
      and strict monitoring of highly resistant CRKP is required.

      carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae isolates in Iran. METHODS: From
      October 2018 until the end of April 2020, different clinical samples were
      collected and K. pneumoniae isolates were identified using conventional
      biochemical tests and PCR assay. Antibiotic susceptibility pattern was
      determined using the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method. Modified Hedge
      Test (MHT) was applied to the identification of carbapenemase-producing K.
      pneumoniae. ESBL and AmpC-producing K. pneumoniae were detected using
      Double Disc Test (DDT) and Disc Potentiation Test (DPT), respectively. The
      presence of carbapenemase, ESBL, and AmpC encoding genes was screened by
      Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) assay. RESULTS: A total of 100 K.
      pneumoniae isolates were collected. K. pneumoniae isolates had the highest
      resistance rate to cefazolin (66%) and cefotaxime (66%). Meropenem and
      amikacin with sensitivity rates of 76% and 69% were the most effective
      antimicrobial agents on K. pneumoniae isolates. It was found that 12
      (12%), 27 (27%), and 9 (9%) K. pneumoniae isolates were positive in MHT,
      DDT, and DPT tests, respectively. Among the carbapenemase-encoding genes,
      bla(OXA-48) (24%) and bla(IMP) (13%) genes had the highest frequency,
      while bla(KPC) and bla(GIM) genes were not detected among K. pneumoniae
      isolates. bla(TEM) (48%) and bla(CMY) (8%) genes had the highest frequency
      among ESBL and AmpC β-lactamase-encoding genes, respectively. CONCLUSIONS:
      It is vital to adopt effective control strategies for K. pneumoniae
      infections and ensure rapid identification of antibiotic resistance
      profile.

      (KPC-39), a single-amino-acid variant of KPC-3 (A172T). Cloning
      experiments, steady-state kinetic parameters, and molecular dynamics
      simulations revealed a loss of carbapenemase activity and increased
      affinity for CAZ. KPC-39 was identified in a patient without prior
      exposure to CAZ-AVI, suggesting silent dissemination in European health
      care settings.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Risk factors for carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales
      (CPE) acquisition/infection and associated clinical outcomes have been
      evaluated in the context of clonal, species-specific outbreaks. Equivalent
      analyses for complex, multi-species outbreaks, which are increasingly
      common, are lacking. METHODS: Between December 2010 and January 2017, a
      case-control study of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing
      organism (KPCO) acquisition was undertaken using electronic health records
      from inpatients in a US academic medical centre and long-term acute care
      hospital (LTACH) with ongoing multi-species KPCO transmission despite a
      robust CPE screening programme. Cases had a first KPCO-positive culture
      >48 h after admission, and included colonizations and infections (defined
      by clinical records). Controls had at least two negative perirectal
      screens and no positive cultures. Risk factors for KPCO acquisition, first
      infection following acquisition, and 14-day mortality following each
      episode of infection were identified using multi-variable logistic
      regression. RESULTS: In 303 cases (89 with at least one infection) and
      5929 controls, risk factors for KPCO acquisition included: longer
      inpatient stay, transfusion, complex thoracic pathology, mechanical
      ventilation, dialysis, and exposure to carbapenems and
      β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors. Exposure to other KPCO-colonized patients
      was only a risk factor for acquisition in a single unit, suggesting that
      direct patient-to-patient transmission did not play a major role. There
      were 15 species of KPCO; 61 (20%) cases were colonized/infected with more
      than one species. Fourteen-day mortality following non-urinary KPCO
      infection was 20% (20/97 episodes) and was associated with failure to
      achieve source control. CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare exposures, antimicrobials
      and invasive procedures increased the risk of KPCO colonization/infection,
      suggesting potential targets for infection control interventions in
      multi-species outbreaks. Evidence for patient-to-patient transmission was
      limited.

TI  - Detection of carbapenemase- and ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae from
      bovine bulk milk and comparison with clinical human isolates in Italy

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae is the most common Klebsiella species infecting
      animals and is one of the causing agents of mastitis in cows. The rise of
      antimicrobial resistance in K. pneumoniae, particularly in strains
      producing extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) and/or carbapenemases, is
      of concern worldwide. Recently (Regulation UE No 2022/1255), carbapenems
      and cephalosporins in combination with β-lactamase inhibitors have been
      reserved only to human treatments in the European Union. The aim of this
      study was to investigate the role of cattle as carrier of human pathogenic
      carbapenem-resistant (CR) and ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae. On this
      purpose, a study involving 150 dairy farms in Parma province (Northern
      Italy) and 14 non replicate K. pneumoniae isolates from patients admitted
      at Parma University-Hospital was planned. Four multidrug resistant (MDR)
      K. pneumoniae strains were detected from 258 milk filters collected
      between 2019 and 2021. One carbapenemase KPC-3-positive K. pneumoniae
      ST307 (0.4 %; 95 % CI - 0.07 - 2.2) was detected in milk filters. The
      isolate also harboured OXA-9, CTX-M-15 and SHV-106 determinants, together
      with genes conferring resistance to aminoglycosides (aac(3')-IIa, aph
      (3″)-Ib, aph (6)-Id), fluoroquinolones (oqxA, oqxB, qnrB1), phosphonic
      acids (fosA6), sulphonamides (sul2), tetracyclines (tet(A)6) and
      trimethoprim (dfrA14). One KPC-3-producing K. pneumoniae ST307 was
      identified also among the human isolates, thus suggesting a possible
      circulation of pathogens out of the clinical settings. The remaining three
      bovine isolates were MDR ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae characterized by
      different genomic profiles: CTX-M-15, TEM-1B and SHV-187 genes (ST513);
      CTX-M-15 and SHV-145 (ST307); SHV-187 and DHA-1 (ST307). Occurrence of
      ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae in milk filters was 1.2 % (95 % CI 0.4-3.4).
      All the isolates showed resistance to aminoglycosides, 3rd-generation
      cephalosporins, and fluoroquinolones. Among the human isolates, two
      multidrug resistant ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae ST307 were found, thus
      confirming the circulation of this high-risk lineage between humans and
      cattle. Our findings suggest that food-producing animals can carry human
      pathogenic microorganisms harboring resistance genes against carbapenems
      and 3rd-generation cephalosporins, even if not treated with such
      antimicrobials. Moreover, on the MDR K. pneumoniae farms, the
      antimicrobial use was much higher than the Italian median value, thus
      highlighting the importance of a more prudent use of antibiotics in animal
      productions.

AB  - We describe an outbreak of Klebsiella pneumoniae sequence type 11 (ST11)
      producing KPC variants resistant to ceftazidime-avibactam. Six patients
      hospitalized in the intensive care unit (mostly due to critical COVID
      pneumonia) presented infection or colonization by this bacterium. They had
      several comorbidities and required mechanical ventilation, central venous
      catheters, and urinary catheters. All 6 patients had a history of fecal
      colonization with KPC-producing Enterobacterales (KPC-E). Three of them
      had previous episodes of infection with ceftazidime-avibactam-susceptible
      KPC-producing K. pneumoniae, which were treated with
      ceftazidime-avibactam. Several phenotypic methods failed to detect
      carbapenemase production in these 6 ceftazidime-avibactam-resistant
      isolates, and they showed in vitro susceptibility to imipenem and
      meropenem. All of them rendered positive results for bla(KPC) by PCR, and
      amplicon sequencing identified bla(KPC-31) variant in 5 isolates and a
      novel variant, named bla(KPC-115), in the other. Moreover, matrix-assisted
      laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry was able to
      detect KPC in all isolates. Ceftazidime-avibactam-resistant isolates, as
      well as those recovered from previous infection episodes (KPC-3-producing
      K. pneumoniae, ceftazidime-avibactam susceptible), displayed a unique
      pulse type and belonged to ST11. Based on whole-genome sequencing results
      of selected isolates, less than 7 single-nucleotide polymorphisms were
      identified among them, which was indicative of the presence of a unique
      clone. Both in vivo selection and horizontal transmission seemed to have
      occurred in our hospital. Detection of these strains is challenging for
      the laboratory. History of previous KPC-E infections or colonization and
      systematic testing for resistance to ceftazidime-avibactam might help
      raise awareness of this possibility. IMPORTANCE Klebsiella pneumoniae is
      one of the main bacteria that cause infections in health care settings.
      This pathogen has developed a high level of resistance to many
      antibiotics. Some K. pneumoniae isolates can produce an enzyme known as
      carbapenemase KPC, making carbapenems (considered the last line for
      therapy) not effective to treat their infections. The combination
      ceftazidime-avibactam, approved by FDA in 2015, is useful to treat
      infections caused by KPC-producing K. pneumoniae. This study describes the
      emergence, in one hospital in Argentina, of K. pneumoniae isolates that
      produce KPC variants (KPC-31 and KPC-115) resistant to
      ceftazidime-avibactam. The ceftazidime-avibactam-resistant bacteria were
      isolated in inpatients, including some that previously received this
      combination as treatment. Transmission of this strain to other patients
      also occurred in the studied period. Detection of these bacteria is
      challenging for the laboratory. The knowledge and awareness of the
      emergence of this pathogen in our region are highly valuable.

AB  - INTRODUCTION/OBJECTIVE: To describe an outbreak of KPC-3-producing
      Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPN) and determine the diagnostic efficacy of
      MALDI-TOF in its detection. METHODS: Retrospective study of the KPC-3-KPN
      isolated in 2 hospitals in Ciudad Real. The peak at 11,109kDa±15 was
      sought in the KPN spectra provided by MALDI-TOF. RESULTS: We isolated 156
      KPN strains that carried the bla(KPC-3) gene, with a unique profile
      belonging to ST512 (31 strains studied). There was 25% of infected
      patients, 84% were nosocomial or related to health care and 93% had some
      underlying disease (31% of exitus in the first month). The detection of
      the peak showed 90% sensitivity and 100% specificity. CONCLUSIONS: We
      detected the clonal spread of a KPN ST512 strain producing KPC-3 in 3
      hospitals in Ciudad Real. In addition, we show the profitability of
      MALDI-TOF in the early detection of KPC-KPN.

AB  - The global emergence of carbapenemase-producing bacteria capable of
      hydrolyzing the once effective carbapenem antibiotics is considered a
      contemporary public health concern. Carbapenemase enzymes, once
      constrained to isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae, are now routinely
      reported in different bacteria within the Enterobacterales order of
      bacteria, creating the acronym CRE which now defines Carbapenem-Resistant
      Enterobacterales. CRE harboring different types of enzymes, including the
      most prevalent types KPC, VIM, IMP, NDM, and OXA-48, are now routinely
      reported and more importantly, are now frequently present in many
      infections world-wide. Defining and updating the contemporary epidemiology
      of both the US and global burden of carbapenem-resistant infections is now
      more important than ever. This review describes the global distribution
      and continued evolution of carbapenemases which continue to spread at
      alarming rates. Informed understanding of the current epidemiology of CRE,
      coupled with advances in antibiotic options, and the use rapid diagnostics
      offers the potential for rapid identification and management of
      carbapenem-resistant infections.

AB  - Carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (CPKP) emerged in Greece in
      2002 and became endemic thereafter. Driven by a notable variability in the
      phenotypic testing results for carbapenemase production in K. pneumoniae
      isolates from the intensive care units (ICUs) of our hospital, we
      performed a study to assess the molecular epidemiology of CPKP isolated
      between 2016 and 2019 using pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
      including isolates recovered from 165 single patients. We investigated the
      molecular relatedness among strains recovered from rectal surveillance
      cultures and from respective subsequent infections due to CPKP in the same
      individual (48/165 cases). For the optimal interpretation of our findings,
      we carried out a systematic review regarding the clonality of CPKP
      isolated from clinical samples in ICUs in Europe. In our study, we
      identified 128 distinguishable pulsotypes and 17 clusters that indicated
      extended dissemination of CPKP within the hospital ICU setting throughout
      the study period. Among the clinical isolates, 122 harbored KPC genes
      (74%), 2 harbored KPC+NDM (1.2%), 38 harbored NDM (23%), 1 harbored
      NDM+OXA-48 (0.6%), 1 harbored NDM+VIM (0.6%) and 1 harbored the VIM (0.6%)
      gene. Multiple CPKP strains in our hospital have achieved sustained
      transmission. The polyclonal endemicity of CPKP presents a further threat
      for the selection of pathogens resistant to last-resort antimicrobial
      agents.

AB  - A novel Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) variant, KPC-93, was
      identified in two Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates from a patient
      from China treated with ceftazidime-avibactam. KPC-93 possessed a
      five-amino-acids insertion (Pro-Asn-Asn-Arg-Ala) between Ambler positions
      267 and 268 in KPC-2. Cloning and expression of the bla(KPC-93) gene in
      Escherichia coli, followed by determination of minimum inhibitory
      concentration (MIC) values and kinetic parameters, showed that KPC-93
      exhibited increased resistance to ceftazidime-avibactam, but a drastic
      decrease in carbapenemase activity. Our data highlight that a KPC variant
      conferring resistance to ceftazidime-avibactam could be easily induced by
      ceftazidime-avibactam treatment and that actions are required to control
      dissemination of these determinants. IMPORTANCE Ceftazidime-avibactam
      (CZA) is a novel β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination with activity
      against serine β-lactamases, including the Ambler class A enzyme KPC.
      However, during recent years, there have been increasing reports of
      emergence of new KPC variants that could confer resistance to CZA. This
      has limited its clinical application. Here, we reported a new KPC variant,
      KPC-93, that could confer CZA resistance. KPC-93 possessed a
      five-amino-acids insertion (Pro-Asn-Asn-Arg-Ala) between Ambler positions
      267 and 268 in KPC-2. Our findings have revealed the potential risk of
      bla(KPC) gene mutations associated with CZA exposure over a short period
      of time.

AB  - Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CREs) have been recognized as an
      important threat to global health. CRE cause the majority of the
      difficult-to-treat infections in health-care settings and are associated
      with high mortality. Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing
      CREs, in particular Klebsiella pneumoniae, are globally disseminated and
      responsible for a large number of outbreaks. Development of rapid methods
      for KPC detection can provide great clinical and epidemiological benefits
      to prevent KPC dissemination. The aim of this study was to standardize and
      validate a LC-MS/MS method to detect KPC. This method was also tested
      against a broad variety of species, including CRE with other carbapenemase
      genes and the recently reported mcr-1. For validation, 111 isolates with
      reduced susceptibility to carbapenems were selected (49 KPC-positive and
      62 KPC-negative). The presence of four tryptic peptides related to the KPC
      enzyme was evaluated, and the identification of at least two of them
      classified the isolate as "KPC-positive." The LTLGSALAAPQR and LALEGLGVNGQ
      peptides were both detected in 47 of 49 isolates with the bla(KPC) gene.
      The other two peptides, GFLAAAVLAR and APIVLAVYTR, were detected in 46 and
      19 isolates with the bla(KPC) gene, respectively. The method correctly
      classified 47 of 49 KPC-positive and all KPC-negative isolates yielding
      96.07% of sensitivity and 100% of specificity. In conclusion, our results
      demonstrate that the KPC peptide markers were robustly detected by the
      method which presented high sensitivity and full specificity and therefore
      can be used as a reliable method to identify this resistance mechanism.

AB  - Aims: The emergence of multidrug-resistant and carbapenem-resistant
      Klebsiella pneumoniae has became a major public health threat. In this
      study, we describe the characteristics of isolates coproducing KPC and
      NDM-1 carbapenemases from patients hospitalized at an emergency unit in
      Ankara, Turkey, between January and August 2018. The isolates were
      characterized by antibiogram susceptibility, carbapenemase and
      extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production, plasmid-mediated colistin
      (COL) resistance, and high-level aminoglycoside resistance. Pulsed field
      gel electrophoresis (PFGE), sequencing, wzi typing, multilocus sequence
      typing, and plasmid analysis were used to investigate the epidemiological
      relationship between the isolates. Results: All isolates were found to be
      resistant to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, piperacillin-tazobactam,
      cefotaxime, cefoxitin, cefuroxime, ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem,
      meropenem, ertapenem, amikacin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin, levofloxacin,
      and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The minimum inhibitory concentration
      values for imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem were >32 μg/mL, and >256
      μg/mL for amikacin and gentamicin, and two isolates were found to be
      susceptible to both tigecycline and COL. All strains were positive for
      SHV, CTX-M, and rmtC, and negative for mcr-1 genes. A/C and FIIA(S)
      plasmids were found in all isolates. All isolates had the same PFGE
      pattern: wzi type 93 and ST15. Conclusion: Here, we have documented the
      characteristics of KPC- and NDM-1-coproducing isolates that harbored SHV,
      CTX-M, and rmtC and were typed as wzi 93 and ST15. We conclude that
      continuous monitoring of carbapenemases for unusual carbapenemase
      production is crucial to prevent the spread of these powerful isolates.

AB  - Introduction. A significant cause of mortality in the intensive care unit
      (ICU) is multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria, such as
      Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC). Biofilm production is a key
      factor in KPC colonization and persistence in the host, making the
      treatment difficult.Gap Statement. The aim of this study was to evaluate
      the antibiotic resistance, molecular and phenotypic biofilm profiles of 12
      KPC isolates associated with nosocomial infection in a hospital in
      Pelotas, Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil.Methodology. Clinical isolates were
      obtained from different sources, identified and characterized by
      antibiotic resistance and carbapenemase synthesis following the Clinical
      and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines. Polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) was used to evaluate the presence of carbapenemase (blaKPC)
      and biofilm formation-associated genes (fimA, fimH, rmpA, ecpA, mrkD and
      wabG). Additionally, phenotypic evaluation of in vitro biofilm formation
      capacity was evaluated by Congo red agar (CRA) assay and the crystal
      violet staining method.Results. The 12 isolates evaluated in this study
      presented the blaKPC gene and were positive for synthesizing
      carbapenemases in vitro. In the carbapenem class, 83.3 % isolates were
      resistant and 16.7 % intermediately resistant to imipenem and meropenem.
      Molecular analyses found that the fimA and wabG genes were detected in 75
      % of isolates, while fimH and ecpA were detected in 42 % and mrkD were
      detected in 8.3 % (1). The CRA assay demonstrated that all isolates were
      slime producers and 91.7 % (11) of isolates were classified as strong and
      8.3 % (1) as moderate biofilm producers by the crystal violet staining
      method. The optical density (OD(540nm)) for strong biofilm formers ranged
      from 0.80±0.05 to 2.47±0.28 and was 0.55±0.12 for moderate biofilm
      formers.Conclusion. Our study revealed a high level of antibiotic
      resistance and biofilm formation in KPC isolates obtained from a hospital
      in Pelotas, RS, Brazil.

TI  - First Description of Ceftazidime/Avibactam Resistance in a ST13
      KPC-70-Producing Klebsiella pneumoniae Strain from Portugal

AB  - The combination of ceftazidime/avibactam (CZA) is a novel
      β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor with activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Enterobacterales. Emerging cases caused by
      CZA-resistant strains that produce variants of KPC genes have already been
      reported worldwide. However, to the best of our knowledge, no
      CZA-resistant strains were reported in Portugal. In September 2019, a K.
      pneumoniae CZA-resistant strain was collected from ascitic fluid at a
      surgery ward of a tertiary University Hospital Center in Lisboa, Portugal.
      The strain was resistant to ceftazidime/avibactam, as well as to
      ceftazidime, cefoxitin, gentamicin, amoxicillin/clavulanic acid, and
      ertapenem, being susceptible to imipenem and tigecycline. A
      hypermucoviscosity phenotype was confirmed by string test. Whole-genome
      sequencing (WGS) analysis revealed the presence of an ST13 KPC70-producing
      K. pneumoniae, a KPC-3 variant, differing in two amino-acid substitutions
      (D179Y and T263A). The D179Y mutation in the KPC Ω-loop region is the most
      common amino-acid substitution in KPC-2 and KPC-3, further leading to CZA
      resistance. The second mutation causes a KPC-70 variant in which threonine
      replaces alanine (T263A). The CZA-resistant strain showed the capsular
      locus KL3 and antigen locus O1v2. Other important virulence factors were
      identified: fimbrial adhesins type 1 and type 3, as well as the cluster of
      iron uptake systems aerobactin, enterobactin, salmochelin, and
      yersiniabactin included in integrative conjugative element 10 (ICEKp10)
      with the genotoxin colibactin cluster. Herein, we report the molecular
      characterization of the first hypervirulent CZA-resistant ST13
      KPC-70-producing K. pneumoniae strain in Portugal. The emergence of
      CZA-resistant strains might pose a serious threat to public health and
      suggests an urgent need for enhanced clinical awareness and epidemiologic
      surveillance.

TI  - Population structure of KPC carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae

AB  - In this work, we used a whole-genome sequencing (WGS) approach to study
      the features of KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) spreading in
      a large Italian long-term acute-care rehabilitation facility (LTACRF), and
      to track the dynamics of dissemination within this setting. Thirty-eight,
      non-replicated, KPC-Kp isolates from colonized patients (either already
      colonized at admission or colonized during admission), collected during
      2016, were subjected to antimicrobial-susceptibility testing and WGS. All
      isolates were resistant to β-lactams, with the exception of
      ceftazidime/avibactam (97.4 % susceptible). The second most effective
      agent was fosfomycin, followed by colistin, trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole,
      gentamicin and amikacin (92.1, 86.8, 60.5, 44.7 and 50 % of
      susceptibility, respectively). A large proportion of isolates (n=18/38,
      47.4%) belonged to clonal group (CG) 101, and most of them (n=15) to a new
      sequence type (ST) designated as ST2502. All the CG101 isolates had a
      capsule locus type KL17. The ST2502 harboured the genes encoding for the
      yersiniabactin siderophore and the ArmA methylase, conferring high-level
      resistance to aminoglycosides. The second most represented lineage of
      isolates (16/38, 42.1%) belonged to ST512 of CG258. Analysing WGS data, we
      were able to ascertain the common origin of some isolates imported from
      other hospitals, and to track several clusters of in-LTACRF
      cross-transmissions. The results revealed that, in peculiar
      epidemiological settings such as LTACRF, new KPC-Kp clones different from
      those prevailing in acute-care hospitals and associated with uncommon
      resistance and virulence determinants can successfully emerge and
      disseminate.

AB  - Reports of Gram-negative bacteria harboring multiple carbapenemase genes
      have increased in South America, leading to an urgent need for appropriate
      microbiological diagnosis. We evaluated phenotypic methods for detecting
      Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase 2 (KPC-2) and New Delhi
      metallo-β-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) coexpression in members of the K. pneumoniae
      complex (i.e., K. pneumoniae, K. quasipneumoniae, and K. variicola)
      isolated from human and animal hosts, based on inhibition of
      ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA) and aztreonam (ATM) by dipicolinic acid (DPA),
      EDTA, or avibactam (AVI). While the presence of bla(KPC-2) and bla(NDM-1)
      genes was confirmed by whole-genome sequencing, PCR, and/or GeneXpert,
      coexpression was successfully detected based on the following: (i) a ≥5-mm
      increase in the zone diameter of ATM (30 µg) disks plus AVI (4 or 20 µg)
      and ≥4-mm and ≥10-mm increases in the zone diameters for "CZA 50" (30 µg
      ceftazidime [CAZ] and 20 µg AVI) and "CZA 14" (10 µg CAZ and 4 µg AVI)
      disks, respectively, when we added DPA (1 mg/disk) or EDTA (5 mM) in a
      combined disk test (CDT); (ii) a positive ghost zone (synergism) between
      ATM (30 µg) and CZA 50 disks and between CZA 50 and DPA (1 mg) disks,
      using the double-disk synergy test (DDST) at a disk-disk distance of 2.5
      cm; (iii) ≥3-fold MIC reductions of ATM and CZA in the presence of AVI (4
      µg/mL), DPA (500 µg/mL), or EDTA (320 µg/mL); and (iv)
      immunochromatography. Although our results demonstrated that inhibition by
      AVI, DPA, and EDTA may provide simple and inexpensive methods for the
      presumptive detection of coexpression of KPC-2 and NDM-1 in members of the
      K. pneumoniae complex, additional studies are necessary to confirm the
      accuracy of these methodologies by testing other Gram-negative bacterial
      species and other KPC and NDM variants coexpressed by WHO critical
      priority pathogens detected worldwide. IMPORTANCE Alerts regarding the
      emergence and increase of combinations of carbapenemases in
      Enterobacterales in Latin America and the Caribbean have recently been
      issued by PAHO and WHO, emphasizing the importance of appropriate
      microbiological diagnosis and the effective and articulated implementation
      of infection prevention and control programs. In this study, we evaluated
      methods based on inhibition of ceftazidime (CAZ), ceftazidime-avibactam
      (CZA), and aztreonam (ATM) by dipicolinic acid (DPA), EDTA, and avibactam
      (AVI) inhibitors for the identification of KPC-2- and NDM-1-coexpression
      in members of the K. pneumoniae complex recovered from human and animal
      hosts. Our results demonstrate that inhibition by AVI, DPA, and EDTA may
      provide simple and inexpensive methods for the presumptive detection of
      coexpression of KPC-2 and NDM-1 in members of the K. pneumoniae complex.

AB  - Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, such as KPC-producing Klebsiella
      pneumoniae, represent a major threat to public health. Novel drug
      combinations including imipenem-relebactam (IPM-REL) have recently been
      introduced and have been shown to exhibit excellent activity toward such
      strains. However, there has recently been reports of the in vivo emergence
      of IPM-REL resistance in KPC-producing K. pneumoniae. Here, we evaluated,
      in vitro, the nature of the mutations that lead to IPM-REL resistance in 5
      KPC-producing K. pneumoniae strains, including 2 that produce KPC enzymes
      conferring ceftazidime-avibactam resistance. An in vitro multi-step
      selection assay was performed and corresponding mutants obtained.
      Mutations were identified in OmpK36 as well as 2 different mutant
      derivatives of KPC. Mutant strains exhibited decreased susceptibility to
      β-lactams, including the carbapenems, and meropenem-vaborbactam (MEM-VAB).
      Expression of bla(KPC) gene variants in an Escherichia coli recombinant
      strain resulted in a concomitant increased susceptibility to carbapenems
      and decreased susceptibility to CAZ-AVI, and enzymatic assays showed that
      the inhibitory activity of both AVI and REL was significantly lowered for
      both KPC mutants compared to parental enzymes. Complementation assays
      showed that OmpK36 plays a major role in IPM-REL resistance as well
      resistance to other ß-lactams and β-lactam/ß-lactamase inhibitor
      combinations. Overall, this study showed that (i) IPM-REL resistant
      strains can be obtained from CAZ-AVI-susceptible or -resistant KPC
      producers, (ii) selection of IPM-REL resistance has a collateral effect on
      MEM-VAB susceptibility - indicative of shared resistance mechanisms, (iii)
      and mutations in the KPC sequence may be obtained using IPM-REL selection
      leading to the possibility of vertical and horizontal transfer of this
      resistance trait.

TI  - Predicting the Effects of Carbapenem/Carbapenemase Inhibitor Combinations

      Alternative versus Traditional Approaches to MIC Determination

AB  - Traditionally, the antibacterial activity of β-lactam antibiotics in the
      presence of β-lactamase inhibitors is determined at the fixed inhibitor
      concentration. This traditional approach does not consider the ratio of
      antibiotic-to-inhibitor concentrations achieved in humans. To explore
      whether an alternative pharmacokinetically based approach to estimate MICs
      in combinations is predictive of antimicrobial efficacy, the effects of
      imipenem and doripenem alone and in combination with relebactam were
      studied in time-kill experiments against carbapenemase-producing
      Klebsiella pneumoniae. The carbapenem-to-relebactam concentration ratios
      in time-kill assays were equal to the therapeutic 24-h area under the
      concentration-time curve (AUC) ratios of the drugs (1.5/1). The simulated
      levels of carbapenem and relebactam were equal to their concentrations
      achieved in humans. When effects of combined regimens were plotted against
      respective C/MICs, a sigmoid relationship was obtained only with MICs
      determined by pharmacokinetically based method. The effectiveness of both
      carbapenems in the presence of relebactam was comparable by the results of
      time-kill experiments. These findings suggest that (1)
      antibiotic/inhibitor MICs determined at a pharmacokinetically based
      concentration ratio allow an adequate assessment of carbapenem
      susceptibility in carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae strains and can be
      used to predict antibacterial effects; (2) in time-kill experiments, the
      effects of imipenem and doripenem in the presence of relebactam are
      comparable.

CY  - Netherlands
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the association of Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) rectal colonisation with
      crude mortality and whether this association is independent of the risk of
      KPC-Kp infection. METHODS: This was a prospective cohort study of patients
      followed-up 90 days after a study of rectal colonisation. Cox regression
      was used to study the variables associated with crude mortality.
      Sensitivity analyses for 90-day crude mortality in different subcohorts
      were performed. RESULTS: A total of 1244 patients (1078 non-colonised and
      166 colonised) were included. None of the non-colonised patients and 78
      (47.0%) of the colonised patients developed KPC-Kp infection. The 90-day
      crude mortality was 18.0% (194/1078) in non-colonised patients and 41.6%
      (69/166) in colonised patients. Rectal colonisation was not associated
      with crude mortality [hazard ratio (HR) = 1.03, 95% confidence interval
      (CI) 0.69-1.54; P = 0.85] when the model was adjusted for severe KPC-Kp
      infection [INCREMENT-CPE score (ICS) > 7]. KPC-Kp infection with ICS > 7
      was associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (HR = 2.21,
      95% CI 1.35-3.63; P = 0.002). In the sensitivity analyses, KPC-Kp
      colonisation was not associated with mortality in any of the analysed
      subcohorts, including patients who did not develop KPC-Kp infection (HR =
      0.93, 95% CI 0.60-1.43; P = 0.74). CONCLUSION: KPC-Kp rectal colonisation
      was not associated with crude mortality. Mortality increased when
      colonised patients developed severe KPC-Kp infection (ICS > 7). Rectal
      colonisation was a necessary although insufficient condition to die from a
      KPC-Kp infection.

AB  - Sequence type 410 (ST410) of Escherichia coli is an extraintestinal
      pathogen associated with multi drug resistance. In this study, we aimed to
      investigate the horizontal propagation pathway of a highrisk clone of E.
      coli ST410 that produces Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC).
      blaKPCencoding E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates were evaluated, and
      complete sequencing and comparative analysis of blaKPC-encoding plasmids
      from E. coli and K. pneumoniae, antimicrobial susceptibility tests,
      polymerase chain reaction, multilocus sequence typing, and conjugal
      transfer of plasmids were performed. Whole-genome sequencing was performed
      for plasmids mediating KPC-2 production in E. coli and K. pneumoniae
      clinical isolates. Strains E. coli CPEc171209 and K. pneumoniae CPKp171210
      were identified as ST410 and ST307, respectively. CPEc171209 harbored five
      plasmids belonging to serotype O8:H21, which is in the
      antimicrobial-resistant clade C4/H24. The CPKp171210 isolate harbored
      three plasmids. Both strains harbored various additional antimicrobial
      resistance genes. The IncX3 plasmid pECBHS_9_5 harbored blaKPC-2 within a
      truncated Tn4401a transposon, which also contains blaSHV-182 with
      duplicated conjugative elements. This plasmid displayed 100% identity with
      the IncX3 plasmid pKPBHS_10_3 from the K. pneumoniae CPKp171210 ST307
      strain. The genes responsible for the conjugal transfer of the IncX3
      plasmid included tra/trb clusters and pil genes coding the type IV pilus.
      ST410 can be transmitted between patients, posing an elevated risk in
      clinical settings. The emergence of a KPC-producing E. coli strain (ST410)
      is concerning because the blaKPC-2-bearing plasmids may carry treatment
      resistance across species barriers. Transgenic translocation occurs among
      carbapenem-resistant bacteria, which may spread rapidly via horizontal
      migration.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) has spread across
      the world. The present study focused on exploring the sequences of two new
      KPC-harbouring plasmids in K. pneumoniae. METHODS: Eighteen KPC-harbouring
      K. pneumoniae isolates were collected from a tertiary teaching hospital in
      2014 in Fujian, China, among which two new KPC-harbouring plasmids (pF77
      and pF5) we identified. The characteristics of the plasmids and the
      isolates carrying them were investigated in detail. RESULTS: The two
      KPC-harbouring plasmids (pF5 and pF77) carried the antimicrobial
      resistance genes bla(KPC-2), bla(CTX-M-65), bla(SHV-12), catA2 and fosA3.
      Detailed sequence comparison revealed that the two plasmids might have
      evolved from recombination of the previously reported plasmids pKP1034 and
      pCT-KPC, which were considered to evolve from ancestor plasmids pHN7A8,
      pKPC-LK30 and pKPHS2. Plasmids pF5 and pF77 were non-conjugative and were
      mainly identified in sequence type 11 (ST11) K. pneumoniae isolates.
      Additionally, 4-55 core single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were
      identified in each pair of sequenced isolates that carried the identified
      plasmids. CONCLUSION: Plasmids pF5 and pF77 as well as the previously
      reported plasmids pKP1034 and pCT-KPC were all detected in 2013-2014 in
      South China and were carried by ST11 K. pneumoniae isolates. SNP analysis
      indicated high similarity of the sequenced isolates. Therefore, spread of
      the group of plasmids may be due to an outbreak of clonal dissemination of
      ST11 KPC-producing K. pneumoniae. This study also highlights the
      importance of plasmid analysis in the surveillance and control of
      antibiotic resistance spread in clinical isolates.

AB  - The emergence of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates carrying novel bla(KPC)
      variants conferring ceftazidime-avibactam (CAZ/AVI) resistance is being
      increasingly reported. We evaluated the accuracy of phenotypic methods
      commonly used in routine clinical laboratories in the detection of novel
      K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) enzymes. Additionally, we characterized
      by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) the KPC-ST307-K. pneumoniae isolates
      recovered in our hospital before and after CAZ/AVI therapy. Rectal
      colonization or infection by carbapenem-resistant KPC-3 K. pneumoniae
      isolates (imipenem MIC, 16 mg/L; meropenem MIC, 8 to >16 mg/L) and
      CAZ/AVI-susceptible isolates (CAZ/AVI MIC, 1 to 2 mg/L) were first
      detected in three intensive care unit (ICU) patients admitted between
      March 2020 and July 2020. KPC K. pneumoniae isolates with increased
      CAZ/AVI MICs (8 to 32 mg/L) and carbapenem susceptibility (imipenem and
      meropenem MIC, <1 mg/L) were recovered within 6 to 24 days after CAZ/AVI
      treatment. WGS confirmed that all KPC K. pneumoniae isolates belonged to
      the sequence type 307 (ST307) high-risk clone and carried identical
      antimicrobial resistance genes and virulence factors. The presence of the
      novel bla(KPC-46), bla(KPC-66), and bla(KPC-92) genes was confirmed in the
      K. pneumoniae isolates with increased CAZ/AVI MICs and restored carbapenem
      activity. KPC production was confirmed by immunochromatography, the
      eazyplex Superbug CRE system, and the Xpert Carba-R assay in all KPC K.
      pneumoniae isolates, but not in any isolate using chromogenic agar plates
      for carbapenemase producers (ChromID-CARBA), the KPC/MBL/OXA-48 Confirm
      kit, and the β-CARBA test. Nevertheless, all grew in chromogenic agar
      plates for extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) producers (ChromID-ESBL).
      We report the failure of the most common phenotypic methods used for the
      detection of novel KPC carbapenemases but not of rapid molecular or
      immunochromatography assays, thus highlighting their relevance in
      microbiology laboratories.

AB  - As the first-line antimicrobial agent for the infection caused by
      carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, ceftazidime-avibactam develops drug
      resistance during its ever-growing clinical use. In this study, we report
      multiple novel variants in bla(KPC-2)-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae from
      two separate patients during their exposure to ceftazidime-avibactam. For
      one patient, the bla(KPC-2) gene carried by K. pneumoniae mutated into
      bla(KPC-35), bla(KPC-78), and bla(KPC-33) over the same period, while that
      for the other patient mutated into bla(KPC-79) and further evolved into
      bla(KPC-76) to enhance resistance level, among which bla(KPC-76) and
      bla(KPC-79) were reported for the first time. In contrast with bla(KPC-2),
      the emergent mutations within the Ω-loop conferred high-level resistance
      to ceftazidime-avibactam with a sharp reduction of carbapenemase activity.
      These bla(KPC)-positive K. pneumoniae isolated from sputum (both patients)
      and cerebrospinal fluid (patient 2) belonged to ST11 and ST859,
      respectively. All strains located bla(KPC) alleles on IncFII/IncR
      plasmids, except one on an IncFII plasmid. Such bla(KPC-2) variants first
      appeared after 9 to 18 days of ceftazidime-avibactam usage, but the lack
      of its feasible detection method often led to the assumption of
      ceftazidime-avibactam sensitivity resulting in clinical incorrect usage.
      Subsequent substitution of ceftazidime-avibactam with carbapenems also
      failed, because the bla(KPC-2)-containing K. pneumoniae dominated again.
      Ultimately, treatment failed even with the therapeutic regimen of
      ceftazidime-avibactam combined with carbapenems, because of the inadequate
      concentration of avibactam in infection sites and decreased drug
      sensitivity of strains caused by increased expression of bla(KPC) and
      point mutation of ompK35 and ompK36. As novel KPC variants conferring
      resistance to ceftazidime-avibactam are constantly emerging worldwide,
      quick and efficient laboratory detection and surveillance are urgently
      needed for infection control. IMPORTANCE Carbapenem-resistant K.
      pneumoniae which was classified as the most urgent threat by World Health
      Organization, is the most critical public health concern due to its high
      mortality rate. Recently, the rapid mutation of bla(KPC) has occurred
      during anti-infective therapy, which posed an unexpected challenge for
      both the diagnostic laboratory and clinical practice.

AB  - Carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae emerged as a nosocomial
      pathogen causing morbidity and mortality in patients. For infection
      prevention it is important to track the spread of K. pneumoniae and its
      plasmids between patients. Therefore, the major aim was to recapitulate
      the contents and diversity of the plasmids of genetically related K.
      pneumoniae strains harboring the beta-lactamase gene bla(KPC-2) or
      bla(KPC-3) to determine their dissemination in the Netherlands and the
      former Dutch Caribbean islands from 2014 to 2019. Next-generation
      sequencing was combined with long-read third-generation sequencing to
      reconstruct 22 plasmids. wgMLST revealed five genetic clusters comprised
      of K. pneumoniae bla(KPC-2) isolates and four clusters consisted of
      bla(KPC-3) isolates. KpnCluster-019 bla(KPC-2) isolates were found both in
      the Netherlands and the Caribbean islands, while bla(KPC-3) cluster
      isolates only in the Netherlands. Each K. pneumoniae bla(KPC-2) or
      bla(KPC-3) cluster was characterized by a distinct resistome and
      plasmidome. However, the large and medium plasmids contained a variety of
      antibiotic resistance genes, conjugation machinery, cation transport
      systems, transposons, toxin/antitoxins, insertion sequences and
      prophage-related elements. The small plasmids carried genes implicated in
      virulence. Thus, implementing long-read plasmid sequencing analysis for K.
      pneumoniae surveillance provided important insights in the transmission of
      a KpnCluster-019 bla(KPC-2) strain between the Netherlands and the
      Caribbean.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase–producing K. pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) has
      been endemic in Italy since 2013. In a multicenter cohort study, we
      investigated various aspects of KPC-Kp among patients, including 15-day
      mortality rates and delays in adequate therapy. Most (77%) KPC-Kp strains
      were sequence type (ST) ST512 or ST307. During 2017, KPC-Kp prevalence was
      3.26 cases/1,000 hospitalized patients. Cumulative incidence of KPC-Kp
      acquired >48 hours after hospital admission was 0.68% but varied widely
      between centers. Among patients with mild infections and noninfected
      colonized patients, 15-day mortality rates were comparable, but rates were
      much higher among patients with severe infections. Delays of >4 days in
      receiving adequate therapy more frequently occurred among patients with
      mild infections than those with severe infections, and delays were less
      common for patients with known previous KPC-Kp colonization. Italy
      urgently needs a concerted surveillance system to control the spread of
      KPC-Kp.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: OXA-48 and NDM are amongst the most prevalent carbapenemase
      types associated with Klebsiella pneumoniae worldwide, with an increase in
      their prevalence in recent years. Knowledge on the treatment of
      carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) comes from KPC-producing
      CRKP with limited data available for OXA-48-like and NDM producers. Our
      aim is to review the literature on the treatment of OXA-48-like and
      NDM-producing CRKP with the goal of providing an update on the available
      antibiotic treatment strategies, particularly in light of changing
      carbapenemase epidemiology and increasing antimicrobial resistance. AREAS
      COVERED: We reviewed studies looking at the antibiotic treatment and
      outcome of OXA-48-like and/or NDM-producing CRKP. EXPERT OPINION: The best
      available treatment option for OXA-48 producers is ceftazidime-avibactam,
      where available and when the price permits its use. Colistin remains as
      the second-line option if in vitro susceptibility is demonstrated with an
      appropriate method. There is not enough evidence to support the use of
      meropenem-containing combination therapies for meropenem-resistant OXA-48
      producers. Treatment of NDM producers is an unmet need.
      Ceftazidime-avibactam and aztreonam combination or cefiderocol can be used
      for NDM producers, where available. Higher cefiderocol MICs against NDM
      producers is concerning. Aztreonam-avibactam provides hope for the
      treatment of NDM producers.

AB  - Ceftazidime-avibactam is a potent antibiotic combination against
      Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Enterobacteriaceae
      Here, we describe a unique ceftazidime-avibactam-resistant and
      carbapenem-susceptible K. pneumoniae strain harboring a novel bla(KPC-14)
      variant. This strain was isolated from a New York City patient in 2003,
      which predates the introduction of avibactam. Despite resistance to
      ceftazidime-avibactam, the strain was susceptible to imipenem-relebactam
      and meropenem-vaborbactam. Comprehensive genomic sequencing revealed that
      bla(KPC-14) is harbored on an ST6 IncN plasmid associated with the early
      spread of bla(KPC)IMPORTANCE KPC is currently the most common
      carbapenemase identified in the United States. More than 40 KPC variants
      have been described, of which KPC-2 and KPC-3 are the most frequent
      clinical variants. However, our understanding of the genetic structures
      and β-lactam resistance profiles of other novel KPC variants remains
      incomplete. Here, we report a novel bla(KPC) variant (bla(KPC-14)) and the

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae is an important pathogen that causes pneumonia and
      bloodstream infections, especially in neonates and intensive care
      patients. The carbapenems remain an important therapeutic option for
      clinicians, particularly against cephalosporin-resistant Gram-negative
      pathogens. This increased use of carbapenems at clinics has resulted in
      the evolution and spread of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae. In this
      study, we isolated six bla K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing
      strains belonging to sequence type 258 (ST258) from clinical,
      environmental, and veterinary sources. Antibiotic susceptibility was
      performed on these isolates and the genes responsible for
      extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and metallo-beta-lactamase production
      were screened. The molecular typing was done using multilocus sequence
      typing. Isolated strains were resistant to various antibiotic classes,
      including carbapenems, and carried the carbapenem-resistant gene, blaKPC.
      All strains were susceptible to tigecycline and colistin. This is the
      first report detecting K. pneumoniae ST258 strains in Pakistan.

AB  - Increased relative bacterial load of KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae
      (KPC-KP) within the intestinal microbiota has been associated with KPC-KP
      bacteremia. Prospective observational study of KPC-KP adult carriers with
      a hospital admission at recruitment or within the three prior months
      (January 2018 to February 2019). A qPCR-based assay was developed to
      measure the relative load of KPC-KP in rectal swabs (RL(KPC), proportion
      of bla(KPC) relative to 16S rRNA gene copy number). We generated Fine-Gray
      competing risk and Cox regression models for survival analysis of all-site
      KPC-KP infection and all-cause mortality, respectively, at 90 and 30 days.
      The median RL(KPC) at baseline among 80 KPC-KP adult carriers was 0.28%
      (range 0.001% to 2.70%). Giannella Risk Score (GRS) was independently
      associated with 90-day and 30-day all-site infection (adjusted
      subdistribution hazard ratio [aHR] 1.23, 95% CI = 1.15 to 1.32, P 7, aHR
      2.96, 95% CI = 0.97 to 9.07, P = 0.057). KPC-KP relative intestinal load
      was independently associated with all-cause mortality in our clinical
      setting, after adjusting for age and severe KPC-KP infection. Our study
      confirms the utility of GRS to predict infection risk in patients
      colonized by KPC-KP. IMPORTANCE The rapid dissemination of
      carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales represents a global public health
      threat. Increased relative load of KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae
      (KPC-KP) within the intestinal microbiota has been associated with an
      increased risk of bloodstream infection by KPC-KP. We developed a qPCR
      assay for quantification of the relative KPC-KP intestinal load (RL(KPC))
      in 80 colonized patients and examined its association with subsequent
      all-site KPC-KP infection and all-cause mortality within 90 days.
      Giannella Risk Score, which predicts infection risk in colonized patients,
      was independently associated with the development of all-site KPC-KP
      infection. RL(KPC) was not associated with all-site KPC-KP infection,
      possibly reflecting the large heterogeneity in patient clinical conditions
      and infection types. RL(KPC) was an independent predictor of all-cause
      mortality within 90 and 30 days in our clinical setting. We hypothesize
      that KPC-KP load may behave as a surrogate marker for the severity of the
      patient's clinical condition.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) represent a
      public health concern. The limited antimicrobial options against CPE have
      led to the development of novel antimicrobial molecules. In the present
      study, we characterized the genetic determinants associated with the
      resistance to ceftazidime/avibactam (CAZ-AVI), meropenem/vaborbactam
      (MER-VAB), imipenem/relebactam (IMI-REL) and cefiderocol (CFD) in a
      carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae strain isolated from a
      critically ill patient. METHODS: Genomic DNA was sequenced using Illumina
      iSeq 100 and Minion Oxford Nanopore platforms. Assemblies were performed
      with a de novo approach using short-read, hybrid and long-lead assembly
      approaches. Final assembly was manually curated and carefully verified.
      Circular elements were screened for antimicrobial-resistance genes,
      porins, virulence factors and prophage regions. RESULTS: KPC-Kp
      (KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae) BO743 was resistant to all novel
      β-lactams including CAZ-AVI, MER-VAB, IMI-REL and CFD. The genome of
      strain BO743 is composed of a single chromosome of 5 347 606 bp and three
      circular plasmids of 363 634 bp (pBO743-363Kb), 120 290 bp (pBO743-120Kb)
      and 54 339 bp (pBO743-54Kb). Sequence analysis demonstrated that KPC-Kp
      BO743 co-harboured bla(OXA-181) and novel bla(KPC-121) located,
      respectively, on the pBO743-54Kb and pBO743-120Kb plasmids. KPC-121
      differed by a serine insertion at position 181 than KPC-3. CONCLUSION: The
      description of the genome of KPC-Kp cross-resistant to novel βL-βLICs and
      cefiderocol reveals the presence of numerous antimicrobial resistance
      genes including bla(OXA-181) and novel variant bla(KPC-121). The
      characterization of this multidrug-resistant phenotype provides evidence
      that needs further attention and monitoring of such MDR clinical isolates.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae
      (CR-hvKP) poses serious challenges to public health. Only a few sporadic
      reports of strains co-producing NDM-1 and KPC-2 (NDM-1-KPC-2-CR-hvKP
      strains) are available to date. OBJECTIVES: This retrospective study
      investigated the clinical features, prevalence and antibiotic resistance
      of hvKP in a tertiary hospital in central China, and characterized an
      NDM-1-KPC-2-CR-hvKP strain (KP169). METHODS: Clinical data were collected.
      Antimicrobial and virulence-associated phenotyping and genotyping,
      capsular serotype gene analysis and multi-locus sequence typing of hvKP
      isolates were performed. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on
      strain KP169. RESULTS: Forty-five of 109 K. pneumoniae clinical isolates
      were hvKP. Of these, 37 originated from nosocomial infections and 24
      expressed carbapenemases. Eight NDM-1-KPC-2-CR-hvKP strains were
      identified, and enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus polymerase
      chain reaction showed that they were clonally related. WGS revealed that
      strain KP169, which belongs to ST11-K64, had a single 5.5-Mb chromosome
      and six plasmids of 5.5-221.6 kb. The bla(NDM-1) gene was located on
      plasmid pKP169-P3, and bla(KPC-2), bla(SHV-12) and bla(TEM-1) were located
      on IncFII/IncR pKP169-P2. IncHI 1/IncFIB virulence plasmid pKP169-P1 was
      similar to pKPC-CR-hvKP-C789 plasmid reported previously. Plasmid
      stability testing showed that bla(KPC-2)- and bla(NDM-1)-harbouring
      plasmids were maintained stably in the host. CONCLUSION: To the best of
      the authors' knowledge, this study identified the largest cohort, to date,
      of eight NDM-1-KPC-2-CR-hvKP strains, and suggests that antimicrobial
      stewardship and protocols to prevent transmission are needed urgently.

AB  - Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) was epidemic around the
      world and become a global threat to public health. The most important
      carbapenem-resistant mechanism is producing carbapenemases, especially
      Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), which is prevalent in the
      international clonal complex CC11. The high-risk multidrug-resistant CC11
      is widespread worldwide, and KPC-producing and (New Delhi metallo)
      NDM-producing strains had been reported in this clonal complex before;
      moreover, cases with the CC11 strain faced more severe forms of drug
      resistance and treatment challenges than other clonal complexes. In this
      study, we identified an OXA-232-producing ST437 Klebsiella pneumoniae
      isolate in China, which belonged to CC11. The isolate was resistant to
      β-lactams, aminoglycosides, and fluoroquinolones but susceptible to
      fosfomycin, tigecycline, and colistin. The bla (OXA-232) gene was located
      on a 6141 bp ColKP3-type nonconjugative plasmid, and the plasmid was
      transformed by chemical transformation successfully. This is the first
      report of OXA-232-producing ST437 K. pneumoniae in China, a new clone of
      high-risk multidrug-resistant CC11.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The clinical isolation rates of carbapenem-resistant
      Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-KP) continue to increase. In China, clinical
      CR-KP isolates are mainly attributed to the bla(KPC-2) gene carried on
      plasmids, and the bla(KPC-2) copy number correlates with the expression of
      KPC enzymes, which can cause elevated carbapenem MICs. METHODS:
      Thirty-seven CR-KP isolates were collected at the Second People's Hospital
      of Lianyungang City between January 2020 and March 2021, with no duplicate
      isolates, and were screened for the bla(KPC-2) gene with PCR. Analysis of
      current CRKP resistance to clinically relevant antimicrobials using the
      bioMérieux VITEK(®) 2 bacterial identification card. The multilocus
      sequence types of the strains were confirmed with PCR and DNA sequencing.
      Recombinant plasmids pET20b-bla(KPC-2) and pET20b-CpsG were constructed,
      and the copy numbers of the recombinant plasmids per unit volume was
      calculated based on the molecular weight of the plasmids. After the
      genomes DNA of clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae carrying the bla(KPC-2)
      gene were purified, the bla(KPC-2) gene relative copy number in individual
      K. pneumoniae strains was indicated by the double standard curve method.
      Detection of MIC values changes of K. pneumoniae under imipenem selection
      pressure by broth microdilution method. RESULTS: Among the 37 CR-KP
      strains isolated, only the bla(KPC-2) gene was detected in 30 strains,
      three strains were positive for the bla(NDM-1) gene, two strains carried
      both the bla(KPC-2) and bla(NDM-1) genes, and two strains without
      detectable carbapenem resistance genes. The ST11 clone was predominant
      among the 37 carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates. Drug sensitivity
      testing showed that except for polymyxins (100% susceptible) and
      tigecycline (75.7% intermediate), the 37 CR-KP strains were resistant to
      almost all antimicrobial drugs. The bla(KPC-2) relative copy number in
      nine ST11 clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae was 7.64 ± 2.51 when grown on
      LB plates but 27.67 ± 13.04 when grown on LB plates containing imipenem.
      Among these nine isolates, five CRKP strains exhibited elevated MICs to
      imipenem, while the remaining four strains showed unchanged MIC values to
      imipenem. CONCLUSION: Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates
      may have multiple pathways to achieve high levels of carbapenem
      resistance, and moderate carbapenem pressure can increase the copy number
      of KPC enzyme genes in CRKP strains and enhance the degree of carbapenem
      resistance in the strains.

      blaNDM, blaOXA-23, and blaOXA-48 genes in clinical strains of Klebsiella
      pneumoniae isolated in Tehran, Iran to assess genetic diversity using MLVA
      as a typing method. METHODS: A total of 181 K. pneumoniae isolates were
      obtained from various clinical samples. CLSI 2018 (clinical and laboratory
      standards institute) guidelines were used to determine antibiotic
      susceptibility and the Modified Hodge Test (MHT). To detect blaKPC,
      blaGES, blaVIM, blaNDM, blaOXA-23, and blaOXA-48, the polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) method was used. The MLVA method was used to type K.
      pneumoniae isolates by using PCR for 8 Variable Number Tandem Repeats
      (VNTRs). RESULTS: Imipenem was the most effective antibiotic against K.
      pneumoniae, with 36.5% susceptibility. 100 (55.24%) of the isolates tested
      positive for KPC, and 30 (30%) tested positive for six genes. Thirty MLVA
      genotypes were distinguished, and an examination of diversity indexes
      (DIs) for eight loci revealed that seven different alleles were the most
      polymorphic, with the highest DI of 0.780. CONCLUSIONS: The present study
      showed that MLVA could be helpful for typing clinical strains of K.
      pneumoniae. Our K. pneumoniae isolates are thought to be derived from a
      small number of clones that have undergone minor genetic changes over
      time. The results also showed that this method had great potential to
      differentiate those strains with high phenotypic similarity. The current
      study has revealed some intriguing facts about K. pneumoniae genetic
      relatedness in Tehran, Iran.

AB  - Ceftazidime/avibactam (CAZ/AVI) is regarded as an effective alternative
      antibiotic for the clinical treatment of Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenemase (KPC)-producing isolates. As resistance has been reported in
      some strains, it is critical to understand the key mechanisms contributing
      to the acquired resistance to CAZ/AVI. From January 2018 to April 2020,
      127 KPC-producing carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strains
      (CRKPs) were isolated at a university hospital in Chongqing, China, and 25
      strains showed reduced susceptibility to CAZ/AVI. All
      reduced-susceptibility CRKPs were deficient in Ompk35 and Ompk36 porins,
      and 24 strains had a premature termination at amino acid position 63 in
      Ompk35 and 134 to 135 glycine and aspartic acid (GD) insertion in OmpK36,
      while the bla(KPC-2) expression level showed no significant difference
      compared to that of strain BAA-1705. Four reduced-susceptibility strains
      evolved resistance under selective pressure of CAZ/AVI with the bla(KPC-2)
      expression level increased, and two of these strains had mutations in the
      Ω-loop. The study found a strain of CRKP55 with changes in the resistance
      phenotype during conjugation, evolving from reduced sensitivity to
      high-level resistance to CAZ/AVI. Through plasmid sequencing and reverse
      transcription-quantitative PCR, it was speculated that insertion sequence
      (IS)26-mediated bla(KPC-2) gene amplification caused the MIC value change
      in the conjugant JKP55. Our findings illustrated the potential of CAZ/AVI
      resistance under antibiotic stress and demonstrated that IS26 may mediate
      bla(KPC-2) replication transposition, leading to high-level resistance
      during horizontal gene transfer. Investigation of CAZ/AVI resistance
      mechanisms may offer a unique opportunity to study the horizontal
      evolutionary trajectories of K. pneumoniae high-risk clones. IMPORTANCE
      Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) production is the most common
      mechanism of K. pneumoniae resistance to carbapenems in China. Currently,
      CAZ/AVI is considered a potential alternative therapeutic option for
      infections caused by these isolates. However, there have been increasing
      reports of resistant or reduced-sensitivity strains since the approval of
      this agent. In this study, resistance to CAZ/AVI was induced under
      drug-selective pressure and was caused by bla(KPC-2) overexpression and/or
      substitutions in the Ω-loop of KPC. Additionally, it was demonstrated that
      a conjugative plasmid carrying bla(KPC-2) could transfer horizontally
      between species, and perhaps, IS26-derived tandem amplification of
      bla(KPC-2) during this period led to high-level resistance to CAZ/AVI. Our
      research suggests that IS26-mediated resistance evolution may have
      important implications in guiding clinical antibiotic use.

AB  - KPC-50 is a KPC-3 variant identified from a Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical
      isolate recovered in Switzerland in 2019. Compared to KPC-3, KPC-50 shows
      (i) a three-amino-acid insertion (Glu-Ala-Val) between amino acids 276 and
      277, (ii) an increased affinity to ceftazidime, (iii) a decreased
      sensitivity to avibactam, explaining the ceftazidime-avibactam resistance,
      and (iv) an association with a sharp reduction of its carbapenemase
      activity.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the underlying mechanism of the
      evolution of tigecycline resistance during treatment in a patient infected
      with Klebsiella pneumoniae harbouring bla(KPC-2). METHODS: A total of
      seven clonal K. pneumoniae strains were continuously isolated from a
      patient during hospitalisation. Antimicrobial resistance in the strains
      was determined by antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Multilocus
      sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were
      performed to explore the homology of the isolates. Whole-genome shotgun
      (WGS) analysis and cloning experiments were used to investigate the
      underlying mechanism of the evolution of tigecycline resistance. RESULTS:
      All of the isolates had a minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) for
      tigecycline of 4 µg/mL, except strain FK6768 that had a MIC of 32 µg/mL.
      Carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae strains (FK6614, FK6768 and FK6809)
      were consecutively isolated from faeces at different times. Antimicrobial
      susceptibility testing indicated that tigecycline resistance increased in
      FK6768 and subsequently decreased in FK6809, which attracted our
      attention. WGS and further bioinformatics analysis showed a homology for
      the three faecal isolates of >99%. The bla(KPC-2) carbapenemase gene and a
      tet(A) mutation were found in tigecycline-resistant isolate FK6768.
      Subsequent cloning experiments confirmed the contribution of a tet(A)
      variant to reduced tigecycline susceptibility. CONCLUSION: Here we report
      a K. pneumoniae isolate carrying both tet(A) mutation and the bla(KPC-2)
      gene, which led to increased tigecycline resistance during tigecycline
      treatment. This is the first report describing tigecycline resistance of
      K. pneumoniae first increasing and subsequently decreasing in vivo.

AB  - In this study, we evaluated the performance of the two commercial methods
      (Rapidec Carba NP and NG-Test Carba-5) for the rapid detection of
      carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. A total of 224 Klebsiella
      pneumoniae strains previously characterized for carbapenemase genes by
      polymerase chain reaction were included in the study. The strain
      collection included 30 non-carbapenemase producers, 85 OXA-48-like, 59
      NDM, 14 IMP, 7 KPC, 7 VIM, 19 OXA-48-like plus NDM, and 3 KPC plus NDM
      producers. Rapidec Carba NP and NG-Test Carba 5 was performed according to
      the manufacturer's instructions. NG-Test Carba 5 correctly detected all
      carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae, however, Rapidec Carba NP failed to
      detect 41% of OXA-48-like producers even with extended incubation time.
      The overall sensitivity and specificity were 81,9% and 100% for Rapidec
      Carba NP, 100% and 100% for NG-Test Carba 5, respectively. Both tests seem
      to be fast and reliable for the detection of carbapenemase-producing K.
      pneumoniae especially for microbiology laboratories where molecular tests
      cannot be performed. However, Rapidec Carba NP with weak hydrolysis
      activity for OXA-48 like might be used in regions where OXA-48 is not
      prevalent. The additional advantage of NG-Test Carba 5 is that it
      specifically detects carbapenemases giving way to threat-related
      infections with an effective drug such as ceftazidime-avibactam or
      meropenem- vaborbactam.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The increase in carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae
      (CRKP) infections is of great concern because of limited treatment
      options. New antimicrobials were recently approved for clinical therapy.
      This study evaluated the epidemiology of carbapenemase-producing K.
      pneumoniae isolates collected at a Greek university hospital during
      2017-2020, and their susceptibilities to ceftazidime-avibactam (CAZ/AVI),
      meropenem-vaborbactam (M/V), imipenem-relebactam (I/R), eravacycline,
      plazomicin, and comparators. METHODS: Minimum inhibitory concentrations
      (MICs) were evaluated by Etest. Only colistin MICs were determined by the
      broth microdilution method. Carbapenemase genes were detected by PCR.
      Selected isolates were typed by multilocus sequence typing (MLST).
      RESULTS: A total of 266 carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae strains were
      isolated during the 4-year study period. Among them, KPC was the most
      prevalent (75.6%), followed by NDM (11.7%), VIM (5.6%), and OXA-48 (4.1%).
      KPC-producing isolates belonged mainly to ST258 and NDM producers belonged
      to ST11, whereas OXA-48- and VIM producers were polyclonal. Susceptibility
      to tigecycline, fosfomycin, and colistin was 80.5%, 83.8%, and 65.8%,
      respectively. Of the novel agents tested, plazomicin was the most active
      inhibiting 94% of the isolates at ≤ 1.5 μg/ml. CAZ/AVI and M/V inhibited
      all KPC producers and I/R 98.5% of them. All OXA-48 producers were
      susceptible to CAZ/AVI and plazomicin. The novel β-lactam/β-lactamase
      inhibitors (BLBLIs) tested were inactive against MBL-positive isolates,
      while eravacycline inhibited 61.3% and 66.7% of the NDM and VIM producers,
      respectively. CONCLUSIONS: KPC remains the predominant carbapenemase among
      K. pneumoniae, followed by NDM. Novel BLBLIs, eravacycline, and plazomicin
      are promising agents for combating infections by carbapenemase-producing
      K. pneumoniae. However, the emergence of resistance to these agents
      highlights the need for continuous surveillance and application of
      enhanced antimicrobial stewardship.

AB  - AIMS: Klebsiella pneumoniae has been reported to develop increased
      antibiotic resistance. Ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA) is a novel antibiotic
      with activity against serine-lactamase. Here, we investigated the
      sensitivity of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP) to CZA and the
      mechanisms of drug resistance in our hospital. METHODS AND RESULTS:
      Patient characteristics were obtained from medical records. K. pneumoniae
      and its antibiotic susceptibility were determined using the Vitek-2
      Compact instrument. The antibiotic resistance genes KPC, NDM, OXA-48, VIM,
      IMP, CIM, SPM, TMB, SMB, SIM, AIM and DIM were detected using real-time
      PCR. Multilocus sequence typing was used for genetic RELATEDNESS analysis.
      In total, 121 CRKP strains were isolated from patients in the intensive
      care unit (51·2%), senior ward (12·4%) and neurosurgery department (10%).
      With an average age of 72·5 years, most patients were in care for
      respiratory (34·7%), brain (20·7%), digestive tract (13·2%) and
      cardiovascular (8·3%) diseases. Specimens were predominantly obtained from
      sputum (39·67%), urine (29·75%) and blood (6·61%). CONCLUSION: Of 23
      CZA-resistant CRKP strains (19·01%), ST11 being the most common at 56·52%,
      11 NDM-1-positive (47·83%) and four NDM-5-positive (17·39%) strains were
      detected. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Our study indicates that
      CZA resistance occurs in ~19·01% CRKP strains and that bla(NDM-1) and
      bla(NDM-5) might be critical for resistance.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Knowledge of within-patient dynamics of resistance plasmids
      during outbreaks is important for understanding the persistence and
      transmission of plasmid-mediated antimicrobial resistance. During an
      outbreak of a Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing (KPC) K.
      pneumoniae, the plasmid and chromosomal dynamics of K. pneumoniae
      within-patients were investigated. METHODS: During the outbreak, all K.
      pneumoniae isolates of colonized or infected patients were collected,
      regardless of their susceptibility pattern. A selection of isolates was
      short-read and long-read sequenced. A hybrid assembly of the short-and
      long-read sequence data was performed. Plasmid contigs were extracted from
      the hybrid assembly, annotated, and within patient plasmid comparisons
      were performed. RESULTS: Fifteen K. pneumoniae isolates of six patients
      were short-read whole-genome sequenced. Whole-genome multi-locus sequence
      typing revealed a maximum of 4 allele differences between the sequenced
      isolates. Within patients 1 and 2 the resistance gene- and plasmid
      replicon-content did differ between the isolates sequenced. Long-read
      sequencing and hybrid assembly of 4 isolates revealed loss of the entire
      KPC-gene containing plasmid in the isolates of patient 2 and a
      recombination event between the plasmids in the isolates of patient 1.
      This resulted in two different KPC-gene containing plasmids being
      simultaneously present during the outbreak. CONCLUSION: During a hospital
      outbreak of a KPC-producing K. pneumoniae isolate, plasmid loss of the
      KPC-gene carrying plasmid and plasmid recombination was detected within
      the isolates from two patients. When investigating outbreaks, one should
      be aware that plasmid transmission can occur and the possibility of
      within- and between-patient plasmid variation needs to be considered.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to characterise the co-occurrence of
      bla(KPC) and bla(NDM) in a K64-ST11 carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella
      pneumoniae strain. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by
      the disk diffusion method. Whole-genome sequencing was performed using
      Illumina MiSeq and PacBio II sequencers. High-quality reads were de novo
      assembled using the SOAPdenovo package. Genome annotation was performed
      using the NCBI Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline (PGAP), and genome
      characteristics were analysed using bioinformatics methods. RESULTS:
      Klebsiella pneumoniae strain KPWX136 was resistant to most of the tested
      antibiotics, being susceptible only to polymyxin B and tigecycline. The
      genome of strain KPWX136 is composed of a single chromosome (5 473 976 bp)
      and six plasmids including pA (191 359 bp), pB (134 972 bp), pC (117 844
      bp), pD (87 095 bp), pE (11 970 bp) and pF (5596 bp). Complete sequence
      analysis revealed the resistome of isolate KPWX136, which included
      bla(KPC-2) and bla(NDM-5) together with 23 other resistance genes, of
      which 6 resistance genes were located on the chromosome and 19 on
      plasmids. Virulome analysis showed that KPWX136 carried a large number of
      virulence-associated genes. Meanwhile, 26 genomic islands and 6 prophages
      were predicted within the genome. CONCLUSION: Genetic characterisation of
      K. pneumoniae KPWX136 co-harbouring bla(NDM-5) and bla(KPC-2) showed that
      it carried not only 25 resistance genes and a large number virulence
      factors but also various mobile genetic elements (MGEs) such as plasmids
      and genomic islands. Therefore, we must be alert to the transmission of
      resistance genes and virulence determinants via MGEs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria, particularly
      Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae), are at the forefront of the list of
      causative agents of ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). The treatment
      options for such infections are limited, and various antimicrobial
      combinations have been suggested as alternatives in clinical practice. New
      antibiotics, such as ceftazidime/avibactam, ceftolozane/tazobactam and
      cefiderocol, have shown advantages in both in vitro and clinical studies.
      PURPOSE: To evaluate the in vitro effect of meropenem-ciprofloxacin and
      meropenem-colistin combinations on carbapenem-resistant (CR) K. pneumoniae
      VAP isolates and to determine their susceptibility to new antibiotics.
      METHODS: Seventy-three K. pneumoniae isolates from 176 endotracheal
      samples from VAP cases were studied. Antibiotic susceptibility testing and
      phenotypic detection of extended-spectrum β lactamase (ESBL) and
      carbapenemase production were done. CR K. pneumoniae isolates were tested
      for the five predominant carbapenemase genes (bla (KPC), bla (OXA-48), bla
      (NDM,) bla (VIM), and bla (IMP)). In vitro evaluation of
      meropenem-ciprofloxacin and meropenem-colistin combinations was done by
      MIC test strips. Susceptibility to new antibiotics was tested by disk
      diffusion method. RESULTS: Sixty-three (86.3%) of the isolates were ESBL
      producers and 52 (71.2%) were carbapenem resistant. Bla (NDM) was the most
      prevalent carbapenemase gene (50%), followed by bla (OXA-48), (36.5%) then
      bla (KPC) in (11.5%). Bla (VIM) and bla (IMP) were not detected.
      Meropenem-ciprofloxacin combination showed indifferent effect on all
      isolates, while meropenem-colistin combination showed 25% synergism, 15.4%
      addition and 59.6% indifference. All (100%) CR K. pneumoniae isolates were
      resistant to ceftolozane/tazobactam and 79% were resistant to
      ceftazidime/avibactam, while 96% were sensitive to cefiderocol.
      CONCLUSION: A high rate of carbapenem resistance exists among VAP K.
      pneumoniae isolates. Meropenem-colistin combination and cefiderocol appear
      to be potential treatment options for infections caused by CR K.
      pneumoniae. Resistance to the tested new β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitors
      was high, signifying a major threat.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A lineage of Klebsiella pneumoniae that produces
      carbapenemase-2 (KPC-2), sequence type (ST) 307, emerged in 2017. We
      analyzed the complete sequences of plasmids from KPC-2-producing K.
      pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) ST307, investigated the antimicrobial resistance
      conferred by this strain, and confirmed the horizontal interspecies
      transmission of KPC-carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE)
      characteristics among Enterobacteriaceae. METHODS: We performed
      antimicrobial susceptibility testing, PCR analysis, multilocus sequence
      typing, curing tests, and whole-genome sequencing to characterize
      plasmid-derived KPC-2-producing Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates.
      RESULTS: Sequence analysis of KPC-Kp strain ST307 revealed novel
      plasmid-located virulence factors, including a gene cluster for glycogen
      synthesis. Three Enterobacteriaceae strains were identified in one
      patient: K. pneumoniae (CPKp1825), Klebsiella aerogenes (CPEa1826), and
      Escherichia coli (CPEc1827). The bla KPC-2 gene from K. pneumoniae ST307
      was horizontally transmitted between these strains. The plasmids could be
      transferred through conjugation, because all three strains of bacteria
      contained the type IV secretion system, pilus genes, and tra genes for
      conjugal transfer. The bla KPC-2 gene was located on a truncated Tn4401
      transposon. Plasmids containing the bla KPC-2 gene could not be
      artificially removed; thus, the three strains could not be cured.
      CONCLUSIONS: The ease of horizontal transfer of KPC-Kp ST307 carbapenem
      resistance has serious public health and epidemiological implications.
      This study provides a better understanding of the genetic characteristics
      that can contribute to the growth and spread of KPC-Kp ST307, and their
      association with antimicrobial resistance genes.

      against Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Klebsiella pneumoniae (K.
      pneumoniae) isolates and the frequency of OXA-48, NDM, KPC, VIM, IMP types
      of carbapenemases in the carbapenem-resistant (CR) groups. A total of 346
      isolates (126 E. coli and 220 K. pneumoniae) from nosocomial bloodstream
      infections were included. Carbapenem and fosfomycin susceptibility were
      tested by Etest (bioMerieux, France) and agar dilution methods,
      respectively and evaluated in accordance with EUCAST criteria. The
      presence of OXA-48, NDM, KPC, VIM, IMP types of carbapenemases were
      conducted by using PCR method. Of the total 346 isolates, 185 (41 E. coli,
      144 K. pneumoniae) were CR. Fosfomycin susceptibility of E. coli was
      higher than 95% and was not statistically significant between the CR and
      carbapenem-susceptible (CS) groups. Fosfomycin susceptibility of CS and CR
      K. pneumoniae was 90.7% and 69.4%, respectively, and statistically
      significantly lower in CR group. Of the total 185 CR isolates, 163 (32 E.
      coli, 131 K. pneumoniae) were producing carbapenemases. OXA-48 was the
      prominent carbapenemase type produced by E. coli (96.8%) and K. pneumoniae
      (70.9%). The frequency of NDM and KPC types produced by K. pneumoniae was
      20.6% and 15.2%, respectively. Fosfomycin has substantial in-vitro
      activity against nosocomial CS and CR E. coli and CS K. pneumoniae
      bloodstream isolates. However, due to the risk of emerging resistance with
      fosfomycin monotherapy, combination therapy should be considered to obtain
      the possible additive or synergistic activity. Emerging fosfomycin
      resistance of CR K. pneumoniae isolates is alarming and OXA-48 is still
      the prominent carbapenemase type in Turkey.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Carbapenemase-producing organisms (CPOs) are a growing
      threat to human health. Among the enzymes conferring antibiotic resistance
      produced by these organisms, Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) is
      considered to be a growing global health threat. Reliable and specific
      detection of this antibiotic resistance-causing enzyme is critical both
      for effective therapy and to mitigate further spread. OBJECTIVES: The
      objective of this study is to develop an intact protein mass
      spectrometry-based method for detection and differentiation of
      clinically-relevant KPC variants directly from bacterial cell lysates. The
      method should be specific for any variant expressed in multiple bacterial
      species, limit false positive results and be rapid in nature to directly
      influence clinical outcomes. METHODS: Lysates obtained directly from
      bacterial colonies were used for intact protein detection using liquid
      chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Bottom-up
      and top-down proteomic methods were used to characterize the KPC protein
      targets of interest. Comparisons between KPC-producing and
      KPC-non-producing isolates from a wide variety of species were also
      performed. RESULTS: Characterization of the mature KPC protein revealed an
      unexpected signal peptide cleavage site preceding an AXA signal peptide
      motif, modifying the molecular weight (MW) of the mature protein. Taking
      the additional AXA residues into account allowed for direct detection of
      the intact protein using top-down proteomic methods. Further validation
      was performed by transforming a KPC-harboring plasmid into a negative
      control strain, followed by MS detection of the KPC variant from the
      transformed cell line. Application of this approach to clearly identify
      clinically-relevant variants among several species is presented for KPC-2,
      KPC-3, KPC-4 and KPC-5. CONCLUSION: Direct detection of these enzymes
      contributes to the understanding of occurrence and spread of these
      antibiotic-resistant organisms. The ability to detect intact KPC variants
      via a simple LC-MS/MS approach could have a direct and positive impact on
      clinical therapy, by providing both direction for epidemiological tracking
      and appropriate therapy.

AB  - The ability of VITEK mass spectrometry (MS) in detection of bacterial
      resistance is currently under exploration and evaluation. In this study,
      we developed and validated a VITEK MS method to rapidly test
      carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (CPKP). Solvents, antibiotic
      concentrations, crystal conditions and times, centrifugation speeds, and
      other factors were optimized to design a rapid sample pretreatment process
      for CPKP detection by VITEK MS. The related parameters of the mass
      spectrum were adjusted on the instrument to establish an CPKP detection
      mode. 133 clinically isolated strains of CPKP in the microbiology
      laboratory at the Shenzhen People's Hospital from 2004 to 2017 were
      selected for accuracy evaluation. The fresh suspected strains from the
      microbiology laboratory in 2020 were used to complete the clinical
      verification. Two antibiotics, meropenem (MEM) and imipenem (IPM), were
      used as substrates. These two substrates were incubated with suspected
      CPKP, and the results were obtained by VITEK MS detection. Using this
      method, different types of CPKP showed different detection results and all
      the CPKP strains producing KPC-2 and IMP-4 carbapenemase were detected by
      VITEK MS. Thus, VITEK MS can be used for rapid detection of CPKP,
      especially for some common types of CPKP. This method provides high
      accuracy and speed of detection. Combined with its cost advantages, it can
      be intensely valuable in clinical microbiology laboratories after the
      standard operating procedures are determined.

AB  - The increased prevalence of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae
      (CPE) has made essential the design of quicker tests for CPE detection. In
      the present study, a simple and rapid assay was developed based on
      measurement of the hydrolytic activity of imipenem at a final
      concentration of 65 µg/mL (100 µM) through ultraviolet-visible (UV-Vis)
      spectrophotometry. All measurements were conducted at 297 nm. A total of
      83 carbapenem-non-susceptible CPE, consisting of Klebsiella pneumoniae
      clinical isolates and genotypically characterised as KPC-, VIM-, NDM- or
      OXA-48-producers, were tested. For comparison, 30
      carbapenem-non-susceptible clinical isolates, consisting of Escherichia
      coli and K. pneumoniae and genotypically confirmed as non-CPE, were also
      examined. The spectrophotometric assay enabled efficient discrimination of
      CPE from non-CPE isolates even in 45 min (P < 0.0001). Moreover, the
      presence of phenylboronic acid (PBA) or ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid
      (EDTA) in the reaction mixture was able to inhibit the hydrolytic capacity
      of KPC- or metallo-β-lactamase (MBL)-producers, respectively, while the
      hydrolytic activity of OXA-48-producing strains was not affected by the
      presence of these inhibitors (P < 0.001). The newly developed assay
      presented 100% sensitivity and specificity to detect and differentiate
      KPC-, MBL- and OXA-48-producers compared with genotypic characterisation.
      Thus, the proposed spectrophotometric method can be considered as an easy,
      fast, accurate and cost-effective diagnostic tool for screening
      carbapenem-non-susceptible K. pneumoniae isolates in the clinical
      laboratory.

AB  - AIM: We investigated the clonal diversity of carbapenemase-producing
      Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates from the Shenzhen Children's Hospital,
      China, and drew conclusions on the clinical and public health impact of
      these isolates as multidrug-resistant. METHODS: From January 2014 to
      December 2018, a total number of 36 unique carbapenemase-producing
      clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae were collected out of 900
      clinical isolates in paediatric patients from the Shenzhen Children's
      Hospital, China. After carbapenemase production confirmation,
      antimicrobial susceptibility, resistance determinants and phylogenetic
      relationship were determined. RESULTS: The isolates showed resistance to
      ceftazidime, ertapenem, ampicillin, cefazolin, ceftriaxone, cefotetan,
      ticarcillin, cefaclor, cefpodoxime, azlocillin, cefcapene, mezlocillin and
      ampicillin-sulbactam. Of the 36 Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase genes
      coding isolates, bla (NDM) was the mostly detected 50% (n=18) followed by
      bla (KPC) and bla (IMP) 19% (n=7), bla (VIM) 17% (n=6), bla (OXA-48-like)
      8% (n=3) and bla (SME) 5% (n=2), whereas extended-spectrum β-lactamase
      (bla (SHV)) was predominantly detected 92% (n=33) followed by bla (CTX-M)
      53% (n=19) and bla (CMY) 28% (n=10). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
      typing showed eight different patterns, and twenty-five distinct sequences
      types were observed with ST307 being predominantly identified 11% (n=4),
      followed by ST2407 8% (n=3). Plasmid replicon typing results indicated
      that IncFIS, IncHI2, IncFIC and IncFIA plasmids carry bla (CTX-M,) bla
      (SHV) and bla (NDM) genes. CONCLUSION: This study reports on the
      occurrence and spread of carbapenemase and extended-spectrum β-lactamase
      encoding genes co-existence in sporadic Klebsiella pneumoniae ST307 in
      paediatric patients from the Shenzhen Children's Hospital, China.

AB  - The rapid emergence of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP)
      and the comparatively limited development of new antibiotics pose a major
      threat to public health. Aminoglycosides are important options that can
      lower the mortality rate effectively in combination therapy with β-lactam
      agents. However, in this study, we observed two multidrug-resistant (MDR)
      K. pneumoniae named 1632 and 1864 that exhibited high-level resistance to
      both carbapenems and aminoglycosides. Through whole-genome sequencing
      (WGS), the unusual co-occurrence of rmtB, armA, and bla(KPC-2) genes,
      associating with two key resistance plasmids, was observed in two
      isolates. Notably, we also found that the armA resistance gene and
      virulence factor iuc operon co-occurred on the same plasmid in K.
      pneumoniae 1864. Detailed comparative genetic analysis showed that all
      these plasmids were recognized as mobilizable plasmids, as they all carry
      the essential oriT site. Results of conjugation assay indicated that
      armA-positive plasmids in two isolates could self-transfer to Escherichia
      coli J53 effectively, especially, the p1864-1 plasmid, which could
      cotransfer hypervirulent and multidrug-resistant phenotypes to other
      isolates. Moreover, multiple insertion sequences (ISs) and transposons
      (Tns) were also found surrounding the vital resistant genes, which could
      even form a large antibiotic resistance island (ARI) and could stimulate
      mobilization of resistant determinants. Overall, we report the uncommon
      coexistence of armA plasmid, rmtB-bla(KPC-2) plasmid, and even iuc
      virulence operon-encoding plasmid in K. pneumoniae isolates, which greatly
      increased the spread of these high-risk phenotypes and which are of great
      concern. IMPORTANCE Carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae have
      become a great challenge for antimicrobial chemotherapy, while
      aminoglycosides can lower the mortality rate effectively in combination
      therapy with them. Unfortunately, we isolated two K. pneumoniae from blood
      sample of patients that not only exhibited high-level resistance to
      carbapenems and aminoglycosides but also showed the unusual co-occurrence
      of the rmtB, armA, and bla(KPC-2) genes. These elements were all located
      on mobile plasmids and flanked by polymorphic mobile genetic elements
      (MGEs). What's worse most, we also identified a conjugative virulent MDR
      plasmid, coharboring multiple resistant determinants, and iuc operon,
      which was confirmed could transfer such high-risk phenotype to other
      isolates. The emergence of such conjugative virulence plasmids may promote
      the rapid dissemination of virulence-encoding elements among Gram-negative
      pathogens. This uncommon coexistence of rmtB, armA, bla(KPC-2), and iuc
      virulence operon-encoding plasmids in K. pneumoniae, presents a huge
      threat to clinical treatment. Future studies are necessary to evaluate the
      prevalence of such isolates.

AB  - Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) pose a significant threat to
      global public health. The most important mechanism for carbapenem
      resistance is the production of carbapenemases. Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenemase (KPC) represents one of the main carbapenemases worldwide.
      Complex mechanisms of bla(KPC) dissemination have been reported in
      Colombia, a country with a high endemicity of carbapenem resistance. Here,
      we characterized the dynamics of dissemination of bla(KPC) gene among CRE
      infecting and colonizing patients in three hospitals localized in a highly
      endemic area of Colombia (2013 and 2015). We identified the genomic
      characteristics of KPC-producing Enterobacterales recovered from patients
      infected/colonized and reconstructed the dynamics of dissemination of
      bla(KPC-2) using both short and long read sequencing. We found that spread
      of bla(KPC-2) among Enterobacterales in the participating hospitals was
      due to intra- and interspecies horizontal gene transfer (HGT) mediated by
      promiscuous plasmids associated with transposable elements that was
      originated from a multispecies outbreak of KPC-producing Enterobacterales
      in a neonatal intensive care unit. The plasmids were detected in isolates
      recovered in other units within the same hospital and nearby hospitals.
      The gene "epidemic" was driven by IncN-pST15-type plasmids carrying a
      novel Tn4401b structure and non-Tn4401 elements (NTE(KPC)) in Klebsiella
      spp., Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., and Citrobacter spp. Of note,
      mcr-9 was found to coexist with bla(KPC-2) in species of the Enterobacter
      cloacae complex. Our findings suggest that the main mechanism for
      dissemination of bla(KPC-2) is HGT mediated by highly transferable
      plasmids among species of Enterobacterales in infected/colonized patients,
      presenting a major challenge for public health interventions in developing
      countries such as Colombia.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase genes (bla(KPC)) play an important
      role in carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in China. A rapid
      detection method for bla(KPC) genes and investigations into the molecular
      characteristics of bla(KPC) positive Klebsiella pneumoniae were necessary.
      In this study, an easy and rapid recombinase aided amplification assay
      (RAA) for bla(KPC) was established. This protocol could be completed at
      39°C in 15-20 min. The sensitivity of this assay was determined as 48
      copies per reaction, and the specificity was 100%. The bla(KPC) RAA method
      could be used for clinical diagnosis and epidemiological investigation.
      Among 801 fecal samples from inpatients, 34 bla(KPC) positive isolates
      were identified from each sample, of which 23 isolates were K. pneumoniae.
      ST11 with bla(KPC-2) was the most prevalent type. All these strains were
      multidrug resistant and carried various virulence genes. Fecal carriage of
      bla(KPC) positive carbapenem-resistant K.pneumoniae poses significant
      challenges for public health control.

AB  - Antibiotic combinations, including ceftazidime/avibactam (CAZ/AVI), are
      frequently employed to combat KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae
      (KPC-Kp), though such combinations have not been rationally optimized.
      Clinical KPC-Kp isolates with common genes encoding
      aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (AMEs), aac(6')-Ib' or aac(6')-Ib, were
      used in static time-kill assays (n = 4 isolates) and the hollow-fiber
      infection model (HFIM; n = 2 isolates) to evaluate the activity of
      gentamicin, amikacin, and CAZ/AVI alone and in combinations. A short
      course, one-time aminoglycoside dose was also evaluated. Gentamicin plus
      CAZ/AVI was then tested in a mouse pneumonia model. Synergy with CAZ/AVI
      was more common with amikacin for aac(6')-Ib'-containing KPC-Kp but more
      common with gentamicin for aac(6')-Ib-containing isolates in time-kill
      assays. In the HFIM, although the isolates were aminoglycoside-susceptible
      at baseline, aminoglycoside monotherapies displayed variable initial
      killing, followed by regrowth and resistance emergence. CAZ/AVI combined
      with amikacin or gentamicin resulted in undetectable counts 50 h sooner
      than CAZ/AVI monotherapy against KPC-Kp with aac(6')-Ib'. CAZ/AVI
      monotherapy failed to eradicate KPC-Kp with aac(6')-Ib and a combination
      with gentamicin led to undetectable counts 70 h sooner than with amikacin.
      A one-time aminoglycoside dose with CAZ/AVI provided similar killing to
      aminoglycosides dosed for 7 days. In the mouse pneumonia model (n = 1
      isolate), gentamicin and CAZ/AVI achieved a 6.0-log(10) CFU/lung reduction
      at 24 h, which was significantly greater than either monotherapy (P <
      0.005). Aminoglycosides in combination with CAZ/AVI were promising for
      KPC-Kp infections; this was true even for a one-time aminoglycoside dose.
      Selecting aminoglycosides based on AME genes or susceptibilities can
      improve the pharmacodynamic activity of the combination.

AB  - The inoculum effect (IE) is a well-known phenomenon with beta-lactams. At
      the same time, the IE has not been extensively studied with
      carbapenem/carbapenemase inhibitor combinations. The
      antibiotic-to-inhibitor concentration ratio used in susceptibility testing
      can influence the in vitro activity of the combination. To explore the
      role of these factors, imipenem/relebactam and doripenem/relebactam MICs
      were estimated against six Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase
      (KPC)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae strains at standard inocula (SI) and
      high inocula (HI) by two methods: with a fixed relebactam concentration
      and with a fixed, pharmacokinetic-based carbapenem-to-relebactam
      concentration ratio. The combination MICs at HI, compared to SI, increased
      with most of the tested strains. However, the IE occurred with only two K.
      pneumoniae strains regardless of the MIC testing method. The relationship
      between the MICs at SI and the respective inoculum-induced MIC changes was
      observed when the MICs were estimated at pharmacokinetic-based
      carbapenem-to-relebactam concentration ratios. Thus, (1) IE was observed
      with both carbapenem/relebactam combinations regardless of the MIC testing
      method; however, IE was not observed frequently among tested K. pneumoniae
      strains. (2) At HI, carbapenem/relebactam combination MICs increased to
      levels associated with carbapenem resistance. (3) Combination MICs
      determined at pharmacokinetic-based carbapenem-to-inhibitor concentration
      ratios predict susceptibility elevations at HI in KPC-producing K.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA) and cefiderocol are recently
      commercialized molecules active against highly drug-resistant bacteria,
      including carbapenem-resistant members of the Enterobacteriaceae. Mutants
      resistant to CZA have been described, notably in Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenemase (KPC) producers. Considering the structural similarities
      between ceftazidime and cefiderocol, we hypothesized that resistance to
      CZA in KPC-producing members of the Enterobacterales may lead to
      cross-resistance to cefiderocol. METHODS: CZA-resistant mutants from three
      clinical isolates of the Enterobacterales carrying either bla(KPC-2) or
      bla(KPC-3) were selected in vitro. Mutants with increased MIC to CZA
      compared to the ancestral allele were cloned in a pBR322 plasmid and
      expressed in Escherichia coli TOP10. We evaluated the impact of these
      mutations on cefiderocol MICs and minimal bactericidal concentrations
      (MBCs), and we assessed the impact of bacterial inoculum size on
      cefiderocol MICs. RESULTS: We used 37 KPC mutants with increased CZA MICs.
      Of these, six have been described previously in clinical isolates.
      Compared to the wild-type alleles, increases in the cefiderocol MICs of 4-
      to 32-fold were observed for 75.6% of tested mutants (28/37), MICs
      reaching up to 4 mg/L in E. coli TOP10 for KPC-31 (D179Y-H274Y mutations).
      MBCs and MICs of cefiderocol were similar, confirming the bactericidal
      activity of this drug. Finally, when using higher inocula (10(7) CFU/mL),
      a large increase in cefiderocol MIC was observed, and all isolates were
      categorized as resistant. CONCLUSION: We observed that most of the
      CZA-resistant KPC variants have a possible impact on cefiderocol by
      increasing the cefiderocol MICs. In addition, cefiderocol is greatly
      impacted by the inoculum effect, suggesting that precautions should be
      taken when treating infections with a suspected high inoculum.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) is involved in several hospital and
      community-acquired infections. The prevalence of K.
      pneumoniae-producing-carbapenemase (KPC) resistance genes rapidly
      increases and threatens public health worldwide. This study aimed to
      assess the antibiotic resistance level of K. pneumoniae isolates from
      Makkah Province, Saudi Arabia, during the Islamic 'Umrah' ritual and to
      identify the plasmid types, presence of genes associated with carbapenem
      hydrolyzing enzymes, and virulence factors. The phenotypic and genotypic
      analyses based on the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC), biofilm
      formation, PCR, and characterization of KPC-encoding plasmids based on the
      replicon typing technique (PBRT) were explored. The results showed that
      most isolates were resistant to carbapenem antibiotics and other
      antibiotics classes. This study identified sixteen different replicons of
      plasmids in the isolates and multiple genes encoding carbapenem factors,
      with bla(VIM) and bla(OXA-48) being the most prevalent genes identified in
      the isolates. However, none of the isolates exhibited positivity for the
      KPC production activity. In addition, this study also identified six
      virulence-related genes, including kfu, wabG, uge, rmpA, fimH, and a
      capsular polysaccharide (CPS). Together, the data reported in this study
      indicate that the isolated K. pneumoniae during the pilgrimage in Makkah
      were all resistant to carbapenem antibiotics. Although the isolates lacked
      KPC production activity, they carried multiple carbapenem-resistant genes
      and virulence factors, which could drive their resistant phenotype. The
      need for specialized methods for KPC detection, monitoring the possibility
      of nosocomial transmission, and diverse therapeutic alternatives are
      necessary for controlling the spreading of KPC. This study can serve as a
      reference for clinicians and researchers on types of K. pneumoniae
      commonly found during religious gathering seasons in Saudi Arabia.

AB  - Carbapenem resistance rates increased exponentially between 2014 and 2017
      in Portugal (~80%), especially in Klebsiella pneumoniae. We characterized
      the population of carbapanemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) infecting
      or colonizing hospitalized patients (2017-2018) in a central hospital from
      northern Portugal, where KPC-3-producing K. pneumoniae capsular type K64
      has caused an initial outbreak. We gathered phenotypic (susceptibility
      data), molecular (population structure, carbapenemase, capsular type) and
      biochemical (FT-IR) data, together with patients' clinical and
      epidemiological information. A high diversity of Enterobacterales species,
      clones (including E. coli ST131) and carbapenemases (mainly KPC-3 but also
      OXA-48 and VIM) was identified three years after the onset of
      carbapenemases spread in the hospital studied. ST147-K64 K. pneumoniae,
      the initial outbreak clone, is still predominant though other high-risk
      clones have emerged (e.g., ST307, ST392, ST22), some of them with pandrug
      resistance profiles. Rectal carriage, previous hospitalization or
      antibiotherapy were presumptively identified as risk factors for
      subsequent infection. In addition, our previously described Fourier
      Transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy method typed 94% of K. pneumoniae
      isolates with high accuracy (98%), and allowed to identify previously
      circulating clones. This work highlights an increasing diversity of CPE
      infecting or colonizing patients in Portugal, despite the infection
      control measures applied, and the need to improve the accuracy and speed
      of bacterial strain typing, a goal that can be met by simple and
      cost-effective FT-IR based typing.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Since the introduction of the β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor
      ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA), rapid evolution of resistance has been
      reported in different KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. In
      this multicenter retrospective study, we describe the emergence of CZA
      resistance and evaluate the mutations that might be responsible for the
      restoration of carbapenem susceptibility. METHODS: During a study period
      of 18 months, KPC-producing K. pneumoniae isolates of five hospitalized
      patients were collected with phenotypic development of CZA resistance.
      RESULTS: In vitro restoration of carbapenem susceptibility during
      treatment was observed in 3 isolates. Whole genome sequencing of these
      isolates showed a D179Y mutation in the KPC gene of 2 variants and a KPC-2
      with a Δ242-GT-243 deletion (KPC-14). Two KPC-3 variants showed CZA
      resistance with sustained carbapenemase activity without genomic
      adaptations in the KPC gene. CONCLUSIONS: This study confirms the
      emergence of CZA resistance in KPC K. pneumoniae. The role of carbapenems
      in treating patients with these variants is unclear and combination
      therapies warrant further investigation.

AB  - Colonization by KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) is associated
      with the risk of developing KPC-Kp infection. The impact of the time
      elapsed since a patient becomes colonized on this risk is not well known.
      An observational, prospective, longitudinal cohort study of colonized
      patients undergoing active rectal culture screening to rule out KPC-Kp
      colonization (July 2012 to November 2017). Patients with a positive
      culture at inclusion (colonized at start of follow-up) and those with a
      negative culture at inclusion who became colonized within 90 days
      (colonized during follow-up) were included in the analysis. CART analysis
      was used to dichotomize variables according to their association with
      infection. Kaplan-Meier infection-free survival curves and the log-rank
      test were used for group comparisons. Logistic regression was used to
      identify variables associated with KPC-Kp infection. Among 1310 patients
      included, 166 were colonized at the end of follow-up. Forty-seven out of
      118 patients colonized at start of follow-up developed infection (39.8%)
      versus 31 out of 48 patients colonized during follow-up (64.6%; P =
      0.006). Variables associated with KPC-Kp infection in the logistic
      regression analysis were: colonization detection during follow-up (OR,
      2.74; 95% CI, 1.07 to 7.04; P = 0.03), Giannella risk score (OR, 1.51; 95%
      CI, 1.32 to 1.73; P < 0.001), high-risk ward (OR, 4.77; 95% CI, 1.61 to
      14.10; P = 0.005) and urological manipulation after admission (OR, 3.69;
      95% CI, 1.08 to 12.60; P = 0.04). In 25 out of 31 patients (80.6%)
      colonized during follow-up who developed KPC-Kp infection, infection
      appeared within 15 days after colonization. The risk of KPC-Kp infection
      was higher when colonization is recently acquired during hospitalization.
      In this prospective study, we concluded that the timing of colonization
      was a factor to assess when considering empirical treatment for suspected
      KPC-Kp infection and prophylaxis or infection control. IMPORTANCE In this
      study, it was confirmed that patients who became colonized during
      hospitalization had a higher risk of developing KPC-Kp infection than
      hospitalized patients who were already colonized at the start of
      follow-up. Besides, the risk of infection in the group of patients who
      became colonized during follow-up was greater in the first weeks
      immediately after colonization was confirmed. Our findings support the
      need for designing preventive strategies for patients at the highest risk
      of infection development, including those admitted in high-risk hospital
      wards and those undergoing urological procedures.

AB  - Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales and specifically Klebsiella
      pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-Kp)
      are rapidly spreading worldwide. The prognosis of ventilator-associated
      pneumonia (VAP) caused by KPC-Kp is not well known. Our study tries to
      assess whether ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by a KPC-Kp strain
      is associated with higher all-cause mortality than that caused by
      carbapenem-susceptible isolates. This is a retrospective cohort study of
      patients with VAP due to K. pneumoniae from a 35-bed polyvalent intensive
      care unit in a university hospital (>40,000 annual admissions) between
      January 2012 and December 2016. Adjusted multivariate analysis was used to
      study the association of KPC-Kp with 30-day all-cause mortality (Cox
      regression). We analyze 69 cases of K. pneumoniae VAP, of which 39 were
      produced by a KPC-Kp strain with high-level resistance to meropenem (MIC >
      16 mg/ml). All-cause mortality at 30 days was 41% in the KPC-Kp group
      (16/39) and 33.3% in the carbapenem-susceptible cases (10/30). KPC-Kp
      etiology was not associated with higher mortality when controlled for
      confounders (adjusted hazard ratio [HR], 1.25; 95% confidence interval
      [CI], 0.46 to 3.41). Adequate targeted therapy (HR, 0.03; 95% CI, <0.01 to
      0.23) was associated with all-cause mortality. Assuming the limitations
      due to the available sample size, the prognosis of VAP caused by KPC-Kp is
      similar to VAPs caused by carbapenem-susceptible K. pneumoniae when
      appropriate treatment is used.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global threat that
      requires serious attention, particularly when it is developed against
      colistin, which is considered one of the 'last-resort' antibiotics for
      curing an infection. This study aimed to investigate the AMR profile of
      the Klebsiella (K.) pneumoniae clinical isolates and to obtain the
      comprehensive characteristics of the carbapenemases among the
      carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CR-KP) when isolated. In addition, to
      detect the colistin resistance and investigate the MCR genes in the
      clinical K. pneumoniae isolates for the first time in Jordan. METHODS: A
      total of 179 K. pneumoniae isolates were cultured and they were confirmed
      using the VITEK 2 system and PCR. The antibiotic susceptibilities,
      extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESβL), multidrug-resistant (MDR), and
      CR-KP were determined by using the VITEK 2 system, disc diffusion, and the
      minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) test. PCR was performed to detect
      the MCR and carbapenemase genes. RESULTS: The rates of ESβL, MDR, and
      CR-KP were 48 %, 62 %, and 12.8 %, respectively. High colistin resistance
      of 49.7 % (89/179) was found. Only one MCR-1 (1.1 %) out of the 89
      colistin resistance isolates was detected. Many of the isolates harbored
      the ESβL genes. In particular, the carbapenem genes were detected in 26
      isolates, with 46 % KPC enzyme genes (12/26), 23 % IMP genes (6/26), 19 %
      OXA-48 genes (5/26), 11.5 % NDM-1 genes (3/26) but no VIM gene was found.
      The statistical analyses revealed a significant association between
      colistin resistance and MDR (P ≤ 0.05, Chi-square test). An association
      between colistin resistance and the Piperacillin, Ceftazidime,
      Cefpodoxime, Imipenem, Aztreonam, and Tobramycin resistance was noted.
      CONCLUSION: The study's findings demonstrated the presence of the MCR-1
      gene in the K. pneumoniae clinical isolates for the first time in Jordan
      and indicated that the KPC and IMP encoded carbapenemases were the most
      prevalent K. pneumoniae carbapenemases in Jordan patients.

TI  - The Gastrointestinal Load of Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriacea Is
      Associated With the Transition From Colonization to Infection by
      Klebsiella pneumoniae Isolates Harboring the bla(KPC) Gene

AB  - BACKGROUND: Healthcare-associated infections by carbapenem-resistant
      Klebsiella pneumoniae are difficult to control. Virulence and antibiotic
      resistance genes contribute to infection, but the mechanisms associated
      with the transition from colonization to infection remain unclear.
      OBJECTIVE: We investigated the transition from carriage to infection by K.
      pneumoniae isolates carrying the K. pneumoniae carbapenemase-encoding gene
      bla (KPC) (KpKPC). METHODS: KpKPC isolates detected within a 10-year
      period in a single tertiary-care hospital were characterized by
      pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), multilocus sequencing typing,
      capsular lipopolysaccharide and polysaccharide typing, antimicrobial
      susceptibility profiles, and the presence of virulence genes. The
      gastrointestinal load of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and of
      bla (KPC)-carrying bacteria was estimated by relative quantification in
      rectal swabs. Results were evaluated as contributors to the progression
      from carriage to infection. RESULTS: No PGFE type; ST-, K-, or
      O-serotypes; antimicrobial susceptibility profiles; or the presence of
      virulence markers, such yersiniabactin and colibactin, were associated
      with carriage or infection, with ST437 and ST11 being the most prevalent
      clones. Admission to intensive and semi-intensive care units was a risk
      factor for the development of infections (OR 2.79, 95% CI 1.375 to 5.687,
      P=0.005), but higher intestinal loads of carbapenem-resistant
      Enterobacteriaceae or of bla (KPC)-carrying bacteria were the only factors
      associated with the transition from colonization to infection in this
      cohort (OR 8.601, 95% CI 2.44 to 30.352, P<0.001). CONCLUSION: The
      presence of resistance and virulence mechanisms were not associated with
      progression from colonization to infection, while intestinal colonization
      by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriacea and, more specifically, the load
      of gastrointestinal carriage emerged as an important determinant of
      infection.

AB  - Aim: To investigate the mobile genetic elements harboring bla(KPC) gene in
      carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae recovered during a 6-month
      outbreak in a high-complexity hospital from Ecuador. Results: A total of
      62 isolates belonging to ST258 pilv-I-positive (n = 45), ST25 serotype K2
      (n = 8), ST348 (n = 6), ST42 (n = 1), ST196 (n = 1), and ST1758 (n = 1)
      were collected from intensive care unit (ICU), neurosurgery, burn unit,
      internal medicine, pneumology, and neurology. Pulsed-field gel
      electrophoresis analysis showed two major clusters of ST258 and ST25
      related to bloodstream infections and pneumonia circulating in ICU. The
      PCR assay showed that in non-ST258 isolates, the bla(KPC-2) gene were
      located on the Tn4401a transposon inserted in the transferable pKpQIL-like
      IncFII(K2) plasmid; the whole-genome sequencing of ST258 clone showed two
      plasmids, the bla(KPC-2) gene was located on nonconjugative IncR plasmid,
      whereas the IncFIB/IncFII plasmid lacked ß-lactamase genes. We found an
      IncM plasmid in bla(KPC-2)-harboring Klebsiella pneumoniae ST1758 clone.
      Conclusions: These findings highlight the presence of pKpQIL-like plasmids
      in non-ST258 and nonconjugative plasmids in ST258 isolates causing
      hospital outbreaks.

AB  - This study provides the genomic characterization and clinical description
      of bloodstream infections (BSI) cases due to ST15 KPC-2 producer
      Klebsiella pneumoniae Six KPC-K. pneumoniae isolates were recovered in
      2015 in a tertiary Brazilian hospital and were analyzed by whole-genome
      sequencing (WGS) (Illumina MiSeq short reads). Of these, two isolates were
      further analyzed by Nanopore MinION sequencing, allowing complete
      chromosome and plasmid circularization (hybrid assembly), using Unicycler
      software. The clinical analysis showed that the 30-day overall mortality
      for these BSI cases was high (83%). The isolates exhibited meropenem
      resistance (MICs, 32 to 128 mg/liter), with 3/6 isolates resistant to
      polymyxin B. The conjugative properties of the bla(KPC-2) plasmid and its
      copy number were assessed by standard conjugation experiments and sequence
      copy number analysis. We identified in all six isolates a small (8.3-kb),
      high-copy-number (20 copies/cell) non-self-conjugative IncQ plasmid
      harboring bla(KPC-2) in a non-Tn4401 transposon. This plasmid backbone was
      previously reported to harbor bla(KPC-2) only in Brazil, and it could be
      comobilized at a high frequency (10(-4)) into Escherichia coli J53 and
      into several high-risk K. pneumoniae clones (ST258, ST15, and ST101) by a
      common IncL/M helper plasmid, suggesting the potential of international
      spread. This study thus identified the international K. pneumoniae ST15
      clone as a carrier of bla(KPC-2) in a high-copy-number IncQ1 plasmid that
      is easily transmissible among other common Klebsiella strains. This
      finding is of concern since IncQ1 plasmids are efficient antimicrobial
      resistance determinant carriers across Gram-negative species. The spread
      of such carbapenemase-encoding IncQ1 plasmids should therefore be closely
      monitored.IMPORTANCE In many parts of the world, carbapenem resistance is
      a serious public health concern. In Brazil, carbapenem resistance in
      Enterobacterales is mostly driven by the dissemination of KPC-2-producing
      K. pneumoniae clones. Despite being endemic in this country, only a few
      reports providing both clinical and genomic data are available in Brazil,
      which limit the understanding of the real clinical impact caused by the
      dissemination of different clones carrying bla(KPC-2) in Brazilian
      hospitals. Although several of these KPC-2-producer K. pneumoniae isolates
      belong to the clonal complex 258 and carry Tn4401 transposons located on
      large plasmids, a concomitant emergence and silent dissemination of small
      high-copy-number bla(KPC-2) plasmids are of importance, as described in
      this study. Our data identify a small high-copy-number IncQ1 KPC plasmid,
      its clinical relevance, and the potential for conjugative transfer into
      several K. pneumoniae isolates, belonging to different international
      lineages, such as ST258, ST101, and ST15.

AB  - Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae are a worldwide health problem and
      isolates carrying both bla(KPC-2) and bla(NDM-1) are unusual. Here we
      describe the microbiological and clinical characteristics of five cases of
      bloodstream infections (BSI) caused by carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella
      pneumoniae and Serratia marcescens having both bla(KPC-2) and bla(NDM-1).
      Of the five blood samples, three are from hematopoietic stem cell
      transplantation patients, one from a renal transplant patient, and one
      from a surgical patient. All patients lived in low-income neighbourhoods
      and had no travel history. Despite antibiotic treatment, four out of five
      patients died. The phenotypic susceptibility assays showed that meropenem
      with the addition of either EDTA, phenylboronic acid (PBA), or both,
      increased the zone of inhibition in comparison to meropenem alone.
      Molecular tests showed the presence of bla(KPC-2) and bla(NDM-1) genes. K.
      pneumoniae isolates were assigned to ST258 or ST340 by whole genome
      sequencing. This case-series showed a high mortality among patients with
      BSI caused by Enterobacteriae harbouring both carbapenemases. The
      detection of carbapenemase-producing isolates carrying both bla(KPC-2) and
      bla(NDM-1) remains a challenge when using only phenotypic assays.
      Microbiology laboratories must be alert for K. pneumoniae isolates
      producing both KPC-2 and NDM-1.

AB  - One of the main bactericidal mechanisms of polymorphonuclear neutrophils
      (PMN) is the release of neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs), which
      capture and destroy pathogens. Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kpn) producer of
      carbapenemase (KPC) and belonging to the sequence type 258 (ST258), is a
      hyper epidemic clone that causes a large number of infections worldwide
      associated with high persistence and mortality. It is necessary to
      investigate the interaction of Kpn KPC with the immune system to improve
      prevention and treatment of infections mediated by this bacterium. Based
      on the hypothesis that Kpn is able to subvert PMN-mediated death, the aim
      was to assess whether Kpn KPC ST258 could modulate the bactericidal
      response of PMN, focusing on NETs formation, compared to another
      opportunistic pathogen, as Escherichia coli (Eco). The results showed that
      the release of NETs was absent when PMN were challenged with Kpn KPC,
      while Eco was a strong inducer of NETosis. Moreover, Kpn KPC was able to
      inhibit NETosis induced by Eco. The inhibition of Kpn KPC-mediated NETs
      formation still occurred in spite of exogenous addition of hydrogen
      peroxide (H(2) O(2) ), did not involve bacterial-released soluble factors
      or cell wall components, and was dependent on bacterial viability.
      Moreover, when degranulation was investigated, we found that Kpn KPC
      affected only the mobilization of primary granules, which harbor the
      proteins with more potent bactericidal properties and those related to
      NETosis. In conclusion, Kpn KPC ST258 effectively managed to evade the PMN

AB  - The spread of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing
      Enterobacterales is a public health concern. KPC-encoding bla(KPC) is
      predominantly spread by strains of a particular phylogenetic lineage,
      clonal group 258, but can also be spread by horizontal transfer of
      bla(KPC)-carrying plasmids. Here, we report the transfer of a
      bla(KPC-2)-harboring plasmid via mobilization from K. pneumoniae to
      Citrobacter freundii complex and Morganella morganii strains in a single
      patient. We performed draft whole-genome sequencing to analyze 20
      carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales strains (15 of K. pneumoniae, two
      of C. freundii complex, and three of M. morganii) and all K. pneumoniae
      strains using MiSeq and/or MinION isolated from a patient who was
      hospitalized in New York and Montreal before returning to Japan. All
      strains harbored bla(KPC-2)-containing Tn4401a. The 15 K. pneumoniae
      strains each belonged to sequence type 258 and harbored a Tn4401a-carrying
      multireplicon-type plasmid, IncN and IncR (IncN+R). Three of these K.
      pneumoniae strains also possessed a Tn4401a-carrying ColRNAI plasmid,
      suggesting that Tn4401a underwent interplasmid transposition. Of these
      three ColRNAI plasmids, two and one were identical to plasmids harbored by
      two Citrobacter europaeus and three M. morganii strains, respectively. The
      Tn4401a-carrying ColRNAI plasmids were each 23,753 bp long and incapable
      of conjugal transfer via their own genes alone, but they mobilized during
      the conjugal transfer of Tn4401a-carrying IncN+R plasmids in K.
      pneumoniae. Interplasmid transposition of Tn4401a from an IncN+R plasmid
      to a ColRNAI plasmid in K. pneumoniae and mobilization of Tn4401a-carrying
      ColRNAI plasmids contributed to the acquisition of bla(KPC-2) in C.
      europaeus and M. morganii. IMPORTANCE Plasmid transfer plays an important
      role in the interspecies spread of carbapenemase genes, including the
      Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-coding gene, bla(KPC). We
      conducted whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis and transmission
      experiments to analyze bla(KPC-2)-carrying mobile genetic elements (MGEs)
      between the bla(KPC-2)-harboring K. pneumoniae, Citrobacter europaeus, and
      Morganella morganii strains isolated from a single patient. bla(KPC-2) was
      contained within an MGE, Tn4401a. WGS of bla(KPC-2)-carrying K.
      pneumoniae, C. europaeus, and M. morganii strains isolated from one
      patient revealed that Tn4401a-carrying ColRNAI plasmids were generated by
      plasmid-to-plasmid transfer of Tn4401a from a multireplicon-type IncN and
      IncR (IncN+R) plasmid in K. pneumoniae strains. Tn4401a-carrying ColRNAI
      plasmids were incapable of conjugal transfer in C. europaeus and M.
      morganii but mobilized from K. pneumoniae to a recipient Escherichia coli
      strain during the conjugal transfer of Tn4401a-carrying IncN+R plasmid.
      Therefore, Tn4401a-carrying ColRNAI plasmids contributed to the
      acquisition of bla(KPC-2) in C. europaeus and M. morganii.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The resistance rate of Klebsiella pneumoniae to commonly used
      antibiotics has been increasing rapidly, causing serious concern among
      clinicians and microbiologists. Resistance to carbapenems in K. pneumoniae
      is increasing dramatically in Chinese hospitals. Here we report the genome
      sequence of an NDM-1 and KPC-2 co-producing K. pneumoniae (CRKP380)
      isolated from a bloodstream infection in Hangzhou, China. METHODS: The
      whole genome sequence of strain CRKP380 was determined using an Illumina
      NovaSeq 6000 platform. Antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) were
      identified using the BacWGSTdb server. The phylogenetic relationship
      between strain CRKP380 and other K. pneumoniae strains isolated from
      Hangzhou currently deposited in the NCBI GenBank database was analysed
      using a core genome-based single nucleotide polymorphism strategy.
      RESULTS: Klebsiella pneumoniae CRKP380 was resistant to all antibiotics
      tested except tigecycline and colistin. The genome sequence of K.
      pneumoniae CRKP380 consisted of 75 contigs comprising 5 590 460 bp.
      According to the Pasteur multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme, CRKP380
      belongs to ST11. Eight ARGs were identified in CRKP380, including two
      carbapenemase genes (bla(KPC-2) and bla(NDM-1)). Ten
      phylogenetically-related K. pneumoniae strains from Hangzhou were
      identified with identical ARGs and the same capsular serotype KL105, but
      none of these strains carried the bla(NDM) gene. CONCLUSION: Here we
      report the genome sequence of a K. pneumoniae ST11 clinical strain
      co-carrying bla(NDM-1) and bla(KPC-2) from Hangzhou, China. The genome
      sequence of CRKP380 can be used as a reference sequence for future
      comparative genomic analysis, including the acquisition and mobilisation
      of carbapenem resistance genes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Renal transplant (RT) recipients are especially susceptible to
      carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) infections.
      However, published experience is limited. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the
      characteristics and evolution of RT recipients with KPC infection in our
      hospital. METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of all RT
      recipients with KPC infection in our hospital from December 1, 2017 (first
      case), to July 31, 2019. For each RT recipient infected with KPC, 3
      controls were selected. RESULTS: During the study period, 8 RT recipients
      presented KPC infection. Seven were detected in the first year post-RT.
      The most common site of infection was urine. In 2 cases the germ was
      isolated in blood. The number of patients with diabetes was significantly
      higher in the group with KPC infection (P = .023), and urologic
      interventions were more frequent in those patients (P = .039). No
      differences were found in the immunosuppressive treatment. A total of 62.5
      % of patients required readmission after the KPC infection. One patient
      died of septicemia by KPC. In all these cases, the clone of KPC isolated
      was KPC ST512. CONCLUSION: KPC infection is more frequent in the first
      months after the RT and causes an important number of hospital admissions.
      It can be cause of death in RT recipients, especially in those with
      isolation of the germ in blood. Diabetes and urologic interventions were
      more frequent in this population. The analysis by molecular typing
      suggests exposure to a common source, highlighting the importance of
      preventive isolation measures and surveillance for limiting the
      transmission of this bacteria.

AB  - New alternatives have been under study as treatment due to the problem of
      multidrug-resistant bacteria. Among them, Wickerhamomyces anomalus
      mycocins have shown a great potential against several microorganisms since
      they have high antimicrobial activity, as well as they can be used as fast
      available nutrients and stand several extreme conditions. In this way,
      Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases inhibition by mycocins produced by W.
      anomalus is important. Microdilution assays were carried out to evaluate
      strains inhibition in liquid medium and the test in solid medium were
      carried out. Toxicity was evaluated by both hemolysis and Artemia salina
      Leach tests. W. anomalus supernatant showed 2.36 U/mg β-glucanases
      activity, and antimicrobial activity was evidenced in 100% Klebsiella
      pneumoniae carbapenemase strains up to 0.12 U/mg concentration. Besides,
      there was low toxicity in hemolysis and Artemia salina Leach tests. It is
      suggested that W. anomalus mycocins may be an alternative to develop new
      antimicrobial substances.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We investigated the epidemiological characteristics of drug
      resistance and virulence factors of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella
      pneumoniae (CRKP) isolates from paediatric patients in Shanghai. METHODS:
      CRKP strains were consecutively collected between January and December in
      2018. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by VITEK 2 compact.
      Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to analyse drug resistance
      determinants, virulence genes and plasmid types. wzi sequencing and
      multilocus sequence typing was used to determine clonal relatedness.
      RESULTS: Among 172 CRKP strains, bla(KPC-2) and bla(NDM-5) were the
      predominant carbapenemase genes. Compared with NDM-5, KPC-2 producers
      showed higher resistance rates to fluoroquinolones and aminoglycosides.
      The majority of KPC-2 producers belonged to KL64-ST11 background, while
      NDM-5 producers were mainly identified as KL62-ST48. Plasmid typing shown
      that IncF and IncFIB were the most prevalent plasmids in KPC-2 producers
      and IncX3 was widely spread in NDM-5-KP. Thirty-seven isolates carried
      various hypervirulence genes and the profiles of these genes showed high
      diversity. CONCLUSIONS: The predominant carbapenemase of CRKP strains from
      paediatric patients in Shanghai were KPC-2 and NDM-5. KL47-ST11 KPC-2-KP
      and KL62-ST48 NDM-5-KP were representative clonal lineages. Although not
      prevalent, hypervirulence associated genes have begun to spread. Active
      long-term surveillance should be performed in both drug resistance
      characteristics and virulence factors.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (bla(KPC)) gene is one
      of the most widespread carbapenemase genes in the world. However, there
      are few reports on KPC-producing bacteria in Japan. The aim of this study
      was therefore to investigate KPC-producing K. pneumoniae in Japan.
      METHODS: A KPC-2-producingK. pneumoniae strain (KAM260) was isolated from
      hospital sewage water in Japan in 2018. The complete genome was determined
      by whole-genome sequencing. Subsequent comparative sequence analysis of
      the bla(KPC-2)-carrying plasmid was performed. RESULTS: Klebsiella
      pneumoniae KAM260, belonging to sequence type 3026 (ST3026), harboured the
      bla(KPC-2) gene in 114.6-kbp plasmid pKAM260_2 with IncFIB(pQIL) and
      IncFII(K) replicons. pKAM260_2 was highly identical to pKpQIL-like
      plasmids, which carry bla(KPC) genes and have spread worldwide. pKAM260_2
      had functional conjugation-associated genes and was transferable to
      Escherichia coli. CONCLUSION: pKAM260_2, the self-transmissible plasmid
      carrying thebla(KPC-2) gene, was detected from hospital sewage water in
      Japan and was characterised as a pKpQIL-like plasmid. This plasmid needs
      to be monitored in Japan in the future owing to its high diffusivity.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Enterobacteriaceae
      have been isolated from human patients in many countries across the globe
      but rarely in Saudi Arabia. Here we provide the genomic characterization
      of the first KPC-producing K. pneumoniae isolated from the urine of a
      patient in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, who had a recent travel history to Egypt
      involving a medical procedure. Presence of KPC-encoding gene initially
      detected with the Xpert Carba-R assay was confirmed by traditional PCR.
      Susceptibility testing using the VITEK 2 system, E-test and microbroth
      dilution methods showed that the K. pneumoniae isolate, namely SA01_KPC-2,
      was resistant to all antibiotics except colistin and
      ceftazidime/avibactam. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS), performed on the
      Illumina Miseq instrument, identified the isolate as sequence type (ST)
      383 and serotype KL30-D1 O1v2. Genome assembly of SA01_KPC-2 indicated the
      presence of two plasmids. Plasmid pSA01_KPC-2, of approximately 45.9 kb in
      size, harbored the bla(KPC-2) flanked by ISKpn27 and ISKpn6 and had a
      backbone similar to published KPC-carrying IncX6 plasmids. The second
      plasmid pSA01_incHIB1, a derivative of published 372-kb plasmid pKpvST383,
      carried genes encoding virulence factors and resistance to five classes of
      antibiotics. The isolation of the first KPC producer in Saudi Arabia
      requires high attention and rapid interventions to prevent further spread.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the epidemiology of carbapenem-resistant
      hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-HvKP) and hypervirulent
      carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (Hv-CRKP). METHODS: Totally 436
      K. pneumoniae strains were collected from 7 hospitals in mainland China
      between 2017.01 and 2018.02. Sequence types, serotypes,
      antimicrobial-resistance and virulence genes were analyzed. Additionally,
      string test, capsule stain, Periodic Acid Schiff stain, fitness analysis,
      quantitative real-time PCR and mouse lethality test were also performed.
      Molecular combinations were used to screen putative bla(KPC)(+)-HvKP and
      Hv-bla(KPC)(+)-KP, followed by the confirmation of mouse lethality test.
      RESULTS: Diverse detection rates were found for the virulence genes,
      ranging from c-rmpA (0.0%) to entB (100.0%). According to the molecular
      criteria, 127, 186, 9 and 26 strains were putatively denoted as HvKP,
      bla(KPC)(+)-KP, bla(KPC)(+)-HvKP and Hv-bla(KPC)(+)-KP. Mouse lethality
      test confirmed 2 bla(KPC)(+)-HvKP strains (JS184 and TZ20) and no
      Hv-bla(KPC)(+)-KP. JS184 showed K2 serotype, thin capsule, positive
      exopolysaccharid and string test. TZ20 presented K20 serotype, thin
      capsule, negative exopolysaccharide and string test. Compared with the
      positive control NTUH-K2044, equal galF expression and growth curves were
      confirmed for JS184 and TZ20. CONCLUSIONS: Molecular determination of
      CR-HvKP and Hv-CRKP brings remarkable bias compared with mouse lethality
      test. The exact prevalence of CR-HvKP is less than 1.0%, which of Hv-CRKP
      is much lower.

AB  - In this study, it was evaluated clinical data of 107 patients with
      bloodstream infection (BSI) by Klebsiella pneumoniae and performed
      phenotypic and molecular analyzes in 50.5% (54/107) of the samples, those
      that showed a resistance profile to carbapenemics. The bla(KPC) gene was
      present in 90.4% (49/54) of the samples, bla(NDM) gene in one sample and,
      in 7.4% (4/54) of the samples, no carbapenemase gene was found. In the
      similarity analysis, it was found 4 main clones and 11 samples were not
      genetically related. The median age of the patients was 58 (40-70) years
      old and 60.7% (65/107) were male. When comparing two groups of patients
      with BSI due to K. pneumoniae with and without resistance to carbapenems,
      the variables ICU permanence, renal failure (IR), previous use of
      antimicrobials, Charlson's comorbidity index (ICCi), some invasive
      procedures and death showed a statistically significant difference (p <
      0.05). And when relating death as a dependent variable, IR, liver failure
      and patients with BSI XDR or PDR, were predictors of increased mortality.
      Our study showed a higher mortality rate in patients with BSI due to
      carbapenem-resistant pneumonia with additional resistance or not to
      polymyxins.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Emerging of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella
      pneumoniae (CRKP) is one of the major concerns among healthcare systems.
      This study aimed to investigate the antibiotic susceptibility pattern and
      carbapenemase genes of carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae isolates
      obtained from Iranian hospitalized patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This
      study was performed on 71 CRKP strains isolated from different clinical
      specimens collected in Tehran Heart Center (Tehran, Iran). A Modified
      Hodge test (MHT) was done for the detection of carbapenemase-producing K.
      pneumoniae. The presence of bla (KPC), bla (VIM), bla (IMP), bla (NDM),
      and bla (OXA-48) -type carbapenemases was evaluated by the PCR method.
      RESULTS: We identified 8.82% (71/805) of K. pneumoniae isolates as CRKP by
      MHT test. The antibiotic susceptibility indicated that all isolates were
      resistant to imipenem, meropenem, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cefepime,
      ceftriaxone, cephalothin, ciprofloxacin, and augmentin, and then mostly
      resistant to aztreonam, cefoxitin, gentamicin, and
      trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole with 98.6%, 98.6%, 97.2%, and 94.4%,
      respectively. The lowest resistance was related to amikacin with 46.5%
      (33/71 isolates). The level of imipenem MIC for all carbapenem-resistant
      isolates was estimated ≥32 μg/mL. Among positive isolates for
      carbapenemase genes, the most frequent gene was bla (OXA-48). It was found
      in 48 (67.6%) isolates followed by bla (VIM) in 28 (39.4%) isolates. bla
      (IMP,) bla (NDM), and bla (KPC) genes were identified in 19 (26.8%), 13
      (18.3%) and 5 (7.0%) isolates, respectively. These genes were not detected
      in nine isolates. CONCLUSION: The relatively high frequency of some
      carbapenemase genes suggests major concern about the emergence of isolates
      containing carbapenem resistance genes as a potential health threat.

CY  - Netherlands
AB  - Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) have spread globally and
      led to the limited choice of antimicrobial treatment of K.
      pneumoniae-induced infections. Bacteriophages are considered as an
      effective strategy against bacterial infections. In this study, we
      isolated a novel Klebsiella phage BUCT556A with lytic activity against
      KPC-producing K. pneumoniae, which was a multi-drug resistant isolate.
      Phage BUCT556A had a symmetrical head and a long, non-contractile tail,
      belonging to the family Siphoviridae, order Caudoviridae. Phage BUCT556A
      had a relatively narrow host range, and a medium burst size of 91
      PFU/cell. It was stable at broad temperature/pH range, and exhibited good
      tolerance to chloroform. The genome of phage BUCT556A was a 49, 376-bp
      linear double-stranded DNA molecule with average G + C content of 50.2%,
      and contained 75 open reading frames. There was no tRNA, antibiotic
      resistance, toxin, virulence related genes or lysogen-formation gene
      clusters detected in the genome of phage BUCT556A. Phylogenetic analyses
      based on the major capsid protein Mcp suggested that this phage had a
      close relationship with Klebsiella phage KLPN1. Together, through
      phenotypic combined with genomic DNA sequencing and analyses, our study
      suggests that phage BUCT556A has the potential to be used as a bacterial
      treatment tool for multidrug-resistant strains K. pneumoniae.

AB  - Multidrug resistant (MDR) carbapenemase-producing (CP) Klebsiella
      pneumoniae, belonging to clonal group CG258, is capable of causing severe
      disease in humans and is classified as an urgent threat by health agencies
      worldwide. Bacteriophages are being actively explored as therapeutic
      alternatives to antibiotics. In an effort to define a robust experimental
      approach for effective selection of lytic viruses for therapy, we have
      fully characterized the genomes of 18 Kumoniae target strains and tested
      them against novel lytic bacteriophages (n = 65). The genomes of K
      pneumoniae carrying bla(NDM) and bla(KPC) were sequenced and CG258
      isolates selected for bacteriophage susceptibility testing. The local K
      pneumoniae CG258 population was dominated by sequence type ST258 clade 1
      (86%) with variations in capsular locus (cps) and prophage content.
      CG258-specific bacteriophages primarily targeted the capsule, but
      successful infection is also likely blocked in some by immunity conferred
      by existing prophages. Five tailed bacteriophages against K pneumoniae
      ST258 clade 1 were selected for further characterization. Our findings
      show that effective control of K pneumoniae CG258 with bacteriophage will
      require mixes of diverse lytic viruses targeting relevant cps variants and
      allowing for variable prophage content. These insights will facilitate
      identification and selection of therapeutic bacteriophage candidates
      against this serious pathogen.

AB  - Infections with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae are emerging as an
      important challenge in healthcare settings. Currently,
      carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) are the species of CRE
      most commonly encountered in hospitals. CRKP is resistant to almost all
      available antimicrobial agents, and infections with CRKP have been
      associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality, particularly among
      persons with prolonged hospitalization exposed to invasive devices. We
      report nine patients hospitalized in an intensive care unit (ICU) with
      severe coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) who developed invasive
      infections due to carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (CP-Kp),
      KPC and OXA-48, strains that have not been previously identified in our
      hospital. Despite ceftazidime/avibactam therapy, five patients died.
      Coinfections can contribute to a poor prognosis for patients with
      COVID-19, especially for high-risk populations such as elderly patients.
      Therefore, it is crucial to establish a rigorous program of antibiotic
      administration in intensive care units.

AB  - The worldwide spread of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing
      Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) isolates was reported to be caused by
      dissemination of 1 clonal complex (i.e., clonal group [CG] 258, which
      includes sequence types [STs] 258 and 512). We conducted whole-genome
      sequencing and epidemiologic analysis of all KPC-Kp isolates in France in
      2018 and found that new successful high-risk clones of ST147, ST307,
      ST231, and ST383 are now the main drivers of bla(KPC) genes. The bla(KPC)
      genes were mostly carried by Tn4401a and Tn4401d structures and a new
      non-Tn4401 element. Our epidemiologic investigations showed that the
      emergence of these non-CG258 KPC-Kp isolates in France was linked to
      dissemination of these clones from Portugal. Thus, KPC-Kp epidemiology has
      changed in Europe, at least in several non-KPC-endemic countries of
      western Europe, such as France and Portugal, where CG258 is not the most
      prevalent clone.

AB  - Multi-drug-resistant (MDR) Enterobacteriaceae pose a global threat to
      hospitalized patients. We report a series of colistin-resistant Klebsiella
      pneumoniae blood isolates from Israel and explore their resistance
      mechanisms using whole genome sequencing (WGS). Patients with
      colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae bloodstream infection (BSI) were
      identified during the period between 2006 and 2018. Demographic and
      clinical data were collected, and antibiotic susceptibility testing (AST)
      was performed using three commercial platforms. Long and short read
      sequencing were performed on a PacBio RS II (Pacific Biosciences) and an
      Illumina Miseq (Illumina), respectively. Thirteen patients with
      colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae BSI were identified, and seven isolates
      from seven different patients were successfully revived. Patient records
      indicated that five of the patients were previously treated with colistin.
      AST indicated that six of the seven isolates were colistin resistant and
      four of these isolates were resistant to carbapenems. WGS assigned the
      isolates to four distinct clusters that corresponded to in silico-derived
      multi-locus sequence types (MLST). Three isolates carried bla(KPC-3 )on
      two different plasmids and one carried bla(OXA-48) on a novel IncL/M
      plasmid. All colistin-resistant isolates carried a variety of different
      mutations that inactivated the mgrB gene. We report the first
      comprehensive analysis of a series of colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae
      from Israel. A diverse set of isolates were obtained and colistin
      resistance was found to be attributed to different mechanisms that ablated
      the mgrB gene. Notably, carbapenemase genes were identified in four
      isolates and were carried on novel plasmids.

AB  - We isolated and characterized a carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae
      (CRKP) clinical strain from blood carrying a novel bla (OXA) gene, bla
      (OXA-926), and belonging to ST29, an uncommon CRKP type. The strain,
      130002, was genome sequenced using both short- and long-read sequencing
      and has a 94.9-kb self-transmissible IncFII plasmid carrying bla (KPC-2).
      K. pneumoniae genomes of the ST29 complex (ST29 and its single-allele
      variants) were retrieved and were subjected to single nucleotide
      polymorphism-based phylogenomic analysis. A total of 157 genomes of the
      ST29 complex were identified. This complex is commonly associated with
      extended-spectrum β-lactamase-encoding genes, in particular, bla
      (CTX-M-15) but rarely has carbapenemase genes. The novel plasmid-encoded
      β-lactamase-encoding gene bla (OXA-926) was identified on a 117.8-kb
      IncFIA-IncFII plasmid, which was transferrable in the presence of the bla
      (KPC-2)-carrying plasmid. bla (OXA-926) was cloned and MICs of β-lactams
      in the transformants were determined using microdilution. OXA-926 has a
      narrow spectrum conferring reduced susceptibility only to piperacillin,
      piperacillin-tazobactam, and cephalothin. Avibactam cannot fully inhibit
      OXA-926. bla (OXA-926) and its variants have been seen in Klebsiella
      strains in Asia and Brazil. OXA-926 is the closest in sequence identity
      (89.9%) to a chromosome-encoding OXA-type enzyme of Variovorax
      guangxiensis. In conclusion, OXA-926 is novel plasmid-borne
      narrow-spectrum β-lactamase that cannot be fully inhibited by avibactam.
      It is likely that bla (OXA-926) originates from a species closely related
      to V. guangxiensis and was introduced into Klebsiella > 10 years ago.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae is an important pathogenic bacterium commonly
      associated with human healthcare and community-acquired infections. In
      recent years, K. pneumoniae has become a significant threat to global
      public and veterinary health, because of its high rates of antimicrobial
      resistance (AMR). Early diagnosis of K. pneumoniae infection and detection
      of any associated AMR would help to accelerate directed therapy and reduce
      the risk of the emergence of multidrug-resistant isolates. In this study,
      we identified three target genes (yhaI, epsL, and xcpW) common to K.
      pneumoniae isolates from both China and Europe and designed loop-mediated
      isothermal amplification (LAMP) assays for the detection of K. pneumoniae
      in clinical samples. We also designed LAMP assays for the detection of
      five AMR genes commonly associated with K. pneumoniae. The LAMP assays
      were validated on a total of 319 type reference strains and clinical
      isolates of diverse genetic backgrounds, in addition to 40 clinical human
      sputum samples, and were shown to be reliable, highly specific, and
      sensitive. For the K. pneumoniae-specific LAMP assay, the calculated
      sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values
      (comparison with culture and matrix-assisted laser
      desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry) were all 100% on
      clinical isolates and, respectively, of 100%, 91%, and 90%, and 100% when
      tested on clinical sputum samples, while being significantly faster than
      the reference methods. For the bla (KPC) and other carbapenemases' LAMP
      assays, the concordance between the LAMP results and the references
      methods (susceptibility tests) was 100%, on both pure cultures (n = 125)
      and clinical samples (n = 18). In conclusion, we developed highly
      sensitive and specific LAMP assays for the clinical identification of K.
      pneumoniae and detection of carbapenem resistance.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The frequency of multiple resistant bacterial
      infections, including carbapenems, is increasing worldwide. As the
      decrease in treatment options causes difficulties in treatment, interest
      in new antimicrobials is increasing. One of the promising natural
      ingredients is curcumin. It is known to be effective in bacteria such as
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Burkholderia pseudomallei
      through efflux pump inhibition, toxin inhibition and enzymes. However,
      because its bioavailability is poor, it seffectiveness occurs in
      combination with antibiotics. In the study, the interaction of meropenem
      and curcumin in carbapenemase producing strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae
      was tested. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-nine Klebsiella pneumoniae
      isolates, resistant to meropenem, were used in this study. From those 15
      MBL, 6 KPC, 17 OXA-48 and 1 AmpC resistance pattern were detected by
      combination disk method. Meropenem and Curcumin MIC values were determined
      by liquid microdilution. Checkerboard liquid microdilution was used to
      determine the synergy between meropenem and curcumin. RESULTS: Synergistic
      effects were observed in 4 isolates producing MBL, 3 isolates producing
      KPC, 4 isolates producing OXA-48, and 1 isolates producing AmpC (totally
      12 isolates) according to the calculated FICI. No antagonistic effects
      were observed in any isolates. CONCLUSION: Curcumin was thought to be an
      alternative antimicrobial in combination therapies that would positively
      contribute to the treatment of bacterial infection. The effectiveness of
      this combination should be confirmed by other in vitro and clinical
      studies.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance genes exist naturally in various environments far
      from human usage. Here, we investigated multidrug-resistant Klebsiella
      pneumoniae, a common pathogen of chimpanzees and humans. We screened
      antibiotic-resistant K. pneumoniae from 48 chimpanzee stools and 38
      termite mounds (n = 415 samples) collected in protected areas in Senegal.
      The microsatellite method was used to identify chimpanzee individuals (n =
      13). Whole-genome sequencing was performed on K. pneumoniae complex
      isolates to identify antibiotic-resistant genes and characterize clones.
      We found a high prevalence of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae among
      chimpanzee isolates (18/48 samples from 7/13 individuals) and ceftriaxone
      resistance among both chimpanzee individuals (19/48) and termite mounds
      (7/415 termites and 3/38 termite mounds). The bla(OXA-48) and the
      bla(KPC-2) genes were carried by international pOXA-48 and pKPC-2
      plasmids, respectively. The ESBL plasmid carried bla(CTX-M-15),
      bla(TEM-1B), and bla(OXA-1) genes. Genome sequencing of 56 isolates
      identified two major clones associated with hospital-acquired infections
      of K. pneumoniae (ST307 and ST147) in chimpanzees and termites, suggesting
      circulation of strains between the two species, as chimpanzees feed on
      termites. The source and selection pressure of these clones in this
      environment need to be explored.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae is an opportunistic bacterial pathogen most commonly
      associated with nosocomial infections, especially in intensive care unit
      (ICU) patients. Routine surveillance cultures for carbapenemase-producing
      Enterobacteriaceae have become a common practice for hospital infection
      prevention. The objective of this study was to investigate the genetic
      relatedness of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae carrying bla(NDM) gene
      across multilocus sequence typing (MLST) scheme. Surveillance rectal swabs
      from 4,463 ICU patients admitted to the Rio de Janeiro hospital (March
      2016-2017) were screened on CHROMagar mSuperCARBA. Of these, 631 isolates
      were subjected to VITEK 2 system for phenotypic microbial identification
      and antibiotic susceptibility testing. Out of 631 isolates, 108 were
      identified as K. pneumoniae, 103 of which were confirmed by PCR of 16S-23S
      rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS). Eleven bla(NDM)-positive isolates
      were subsequently screened for bla(KPC), bla(BKC), bla(IMP), bla(VIM),
      bla(SPM), bla(OXA-48), and mcr-1-8 genes. Twenty-seven percent (3/11)
      revealed co-occurrence with KPC, OXA-48, and VIM, 46% (5/11) with KPC and
      VIM, and 18% (2/11) with VIM type. No strains harbored the bla(BKC),
      bla(SPM), bla(IMP), and mcr-1 to 8 resistance genes. All 11 isolates were
      resistant to β-lactams, ciprofloxacin 90%, tigecycline 82%, gentamicin
      73%, and amikacin 18%, and were classified as multidrug resistant (MDR),
      extensively drug resistant (XDR), and pandrug resistant (PDR). Molecular
      epidemiology data based on MLST revealed 11 different STs, 8 of which were
      novel and 3 were previously described. Six out of the eight new STs were
      associated with MDR and PDR strains and two clonal complexes were
      reported, including CC258 and CC15. The coexistence of NDM-producing K.
      pneumoniae and other carbapenemase has been frequently described
      worldwide. Moreover, we report for the first time K. pneumoniae
      co-harboring up to four carbapenemases from active surveillance cultures.

AB  - The threat of antibiotic resistance has increased dramatically in recent
      years. Fosfomycin, an old antibiotic agent, has been re-introduced to
      fight infections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing
      K. pneumoniae (KPC-KP). However, the trend of fosfomycin resistance among
      KPC-KP strains is increasing. In this study, 80 KPC-KP clinical isolates
      were collected from three teaching hospitals during 2014-2017 in China and
      were subjected to whole-genome sequencing (WGS). The fosfomycin resistance
      phenotype and resistance mechanisms were investigated by antimicrobial
      susceptibility testing and carbon source growth test, respectively. Among
      all KPC-KP strains, 80.0% (64/80) were resistant to fosfomycin and 36.3%
      (29/80) were positive for the mobile fosfomycin resistance gene fosA3.
      Among the 63 strains that were unable to grow in M9 basic medium with
      glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) as the sole carbon source (mediated by mutation
      of the target gene glpT), there was no significant difference regarding
      the MIC distribution of fosfomycin between fosA3-positive and
      fosA3-negative strains (P = 0.577). Among the 50 strains that were
      negative for fosA3 but positive for fosA, the fosfomycin MICs of strains
      unable to grow in M9 basic medium with G3P as the sole carbon source were
      significantly higher (P < 0.001) than in strains that were able to grow in
      M9 basic medium with G3P as the sole carbon source. Our findings indicate
      that fosfomycin resistance among KPC-KP in China is an emerging problem
      and the two major mechanisms of resistance identified were
      plasmid-mediated fosfomycin resistance gene fosA3 and mutation of the
      target gene glpT.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The novel carbapenem/β-lactamase inhibitor combination
      imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam has been developed for the treatment of
      infections due to carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE).
      Herein, we describe the in vivo evolution of
      imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam resistance in longitudinal intra-patient
      Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae
      (KPC-Kp) strains isolated from a patient following
      ceftazidime/avibactam-based treatments. METHODS: WGS analysis was
      performed on KPC-Kp strains isolated at different times and during
      antimicrobial treatments from the same patient. Genome assemblies were
      performed using a hybrid approach using Illumina iSeq 100 and Minion
      Oxford Nanopore platforms. Subpopulation analysis and allele frequency
      determination was performed by mapping Illumina reads to blaKPC. RESULTS:
      During antimicrobial treatment, resistance to ceftazidime/avibactam was
      observed following 16 days of antimicrobial therapy. WGS results showed
      that all KPC-Kp exhibited a low SNP rate of divergence, belonged to ST512
      and shared similar antimicrobial resistance and porin gene patterns.
      Genetic analysis demonstrated that the first
      ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant KPC-Kp strain harboured a blaKPC-53 gene
      in a Tn4401 transposon moved from IncFII(K) to a 43 kb IncX3 plasmid,
      while a imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam-resistant strain exhibited two
      copies of the Tn4401 transposon in IncFII(K) and IncX3 plasmids, resulting
      in an increased blaKPC copy number. Of note, frequency analysis
      demonstrated that imipenem/cilastatin/relebactam-resistant KPC-Kp
      consisted of mixed subpopulations harbouring blaKPC-40 and blaKPC-53
      alleles. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show the in vivo evolution of genetic
      rearrangement conferring resistance to imipenem/relebactam in a patient
      with KPC-Kp infection and treated with different
      ceftazidime/avibactam-based treatments. The rapid development of mutations
      and the high adaptability of its genome highlight the potential threat of
      KPC-Kp.

AB  - We analysed a carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) outbreak
      in the coronavirus disease (COVID) ICU. We retrospectively collected data
      from ICU records. We identified 25 cases between 12 November 2020 and 19
      December 2020, and compared them to 42 controls present in the ICU during
      the same period. The presence of a femoral haemodialysis catheter was
      strongly associated with invasive CRKP infections (cases, 9 [36%];
      controls, 0 [0%]; odds ratio [OR] 95% confidence intervals [CIs], 21 (5;
      89)). We found a significant association between old age and CRKP
      infection with adverse outcomes. Sequence analysis revealed three distinct
      carbapenemase genes: bla(NDM-1), bla(OXA-48) and bla(KPC-2). We launched
      rectal swab sampling upon admission to the ICU, cohorted colonized
      patients and cases and conducted an intensive training programme for newly
      employed staff. This study revealed that the emergence and dissemination
      of CRKP in COVID ICUs were associated with increased adverse outcomes. The
      presence of a femoral haemodialysis catheter was a significant risk factor
      for CRKP infections.

AB  - Determining the role of the immune response in preventing antimicrobial
      resistance and optimising antibiotic regimens against
      carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae is a research gap that
      exists and needs to be further explored. The objective of this study was
      to determine the pharmacodynamic and immunomodulatory effects of
      fosfomycin alone and in combination with polymyxin B against
      KPC-2-producing K. pneumoniae clinical isolates. Six K. pneumoniae
      isolates were selected (polymyxin B MIC, 0.5-64 mg/L; fosfomycin MIC,
      16-128 mg/L) to evaluate the pharmacodynamics of monotherapy and
      combination therapies in static time-kill studies. A mechanism-based model
      was used to characterise the joint activity of polymyxin B and fosfomycin.
      A549 human airway epithelial cells were infected with four isolates to
      evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of treatment. Our mechanism-based
      model indicated greater bacterial killing efficacy of fosfomycin with
      polymyxin B compared with monotherapy. In combination, polymyxin B was
      assumed to exert an outer membrane effect that resulted in an increase in
      the ability of fosfomycin to reach its target site. The mechanism-based
      model described the data well across all six strains, with R(2) values
      ranging from 0.705-0.935. Combination therapy reduced K.
      pneumoniae-induced IL-6 and IL-8 but not TNFα expression. The reduction in
      cytokine expression was greater with polymyxin B than fosfomycin alone;
      combination therapy showed significantly greater reduction compared to
      either monotherapy. Our findings suggest that further research is needed
      to better understand immune-mediated killing in order to identify a
      strategy which harnesses the power of the immune response against these
      hard-to-treat bacteria.

AB  - Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) is a global public
      health threat. In this study, we employed whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to
      determine the genomic epidemiology of a longitudinal collection of
      clinical CRKP isolates recovered from a large public acute care hospital
      in Singapore. Phylogenetic analyses, a characterization of resistance and
      virulence determinants, and plasmid profiling were performed for 575
      unique CRKP isolates collected between 2009 and 2020. The phylogenetic
      analyses identified the presence of global high-risk clones among the CRKP
      population (clonal group [CG] 14/15, CG17/20, CG147, CG258, and sequence
      type [ST] 231), and these clones constituted 50% of the isolates.
      Carbapenemase production was common (n = 497, 86.4%), and KPC was the
      predominant carbapenemase (n = 235, 40.9%), followed by OXA-48-like (n =
      128, 22.3%) and NDM (n = 93, 16.2%). Hypervirulence was detected in 59
      (10.3%) isolates and was most common in the ST231 carbapenemase-producing
      isolates (21/59, 35.6%). Carbapenemase genes were associated with diverse
      plasmid replicons; however, there was an association of bla(OXA-181/232)
      with ColKP3 plasmids. This study presents the complex and diverse
      epidemiology of the CRKP strains circulating in Singapore. Our study
      highlights the utility of WGS-based genomic surveillance in tracking the
      population dynamics of CRKP. IMPORTANCE In this study, we characterized
      carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates collected
      over a 12-year period in the largest public acute-care hospital in
      Singapore using whole-genome sequencing. The results of this study
      demonstrate significant genomic diversity with the presence of well-known
      epidemic, multidrug-resistant clones amid a diverse pool of nonepidemic
      lineages. Genomic surveillance involving comprehensive resistance,
      virulence, and plasmid gene content profiling provided critical
      information for antimicrobial resistance monitoring and highlighted future
      surveillance priorities, such as the emergence of ST231 K. pneumoniae
      strains bearing multidrug resistance, virulence elements, and the
      potential plasmid-mediated transmission of the bla(OXA-48-like) gene. The
      findings here also reinforce the necessity of unique infection control and
      prevention strategies that take the genomic diversity of local circulating
      strains into consideration.

AB  - Carbapenemases confer resistance to nearly all β-lactam antibiotics. The
      extensive spread of carbapenemase-producing multidrug-resistant bacteria
      contributes significantly to hospital-acquired infections. We have
      developed a novel protein-based binding assay that identifies KPC
      β-lactamases from clinical isolates. We used the protein-protein
      interaction between KPCs and a soluble β-lactamase inhibitory protein
      (BLIP) variant, BLIP(K74T/W112D), which specifically inhibits KPCs but not
      other β-lactamases. In this assay, BLIP(K74T/W112D) was allowed to form
      complexes with KPC-2 in bacterial cell lysates and then extracted using
      His tag binding resins. We demonstrated the presence of KPC-2 by
      monitoring the hydrolysis of a colorimetric β-lactam substrate. Also, to
      further increase the accuracy of the method, a BLIP(K74T/W112D)-mediated
      inhibition assay was developed. The binding and inhibition assays were
      validated by testing 127 Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates with
      known genome sequences for the presence of KPC. Our assays identified a
      total of 32 strains as KPC-2 producers, a result in 100% concordance with
      genome sequencing predictions. To further simplify the assay and decrease
      the time to obtain results, the BLIP(K74T/W112D) protein was tested in
      combination with the widely used Carba-NP assay. For this purpose, the
      genome-sequenced K. pneumoniae strains were tested for the presence of
      carbapenemases with the Carba-NP test with and without the addition of
      BLIP(K74T/W122D) The test accurately identified carbapenemase-producing
      strains and the addition of BLIP(K74T/W112D) allowed a further
      determination that the strains contain KPC carbapenemase. Thus, the
      BLIP(K74T/W112D) protein is an effective sensor to specifically detect KPC
      β-lactamases produced by clinical isolates.IMPORTANCE Infections caused by
      carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae are associated with high
      therapeutic failure and mortality rates. Thus, it is critical to rapidly
      identify clinical isolates expressing KPC β-lactamases to facilitate
      administration of the correct antibiotic treatment and initiate infection
      control strategies. To address this problem, we developed a protein-based,
      KPC-specific binding assay in combination with a cell lysate inhibition
      assay that provided a 100% identification rate of KPC from clinical
      isolates of known genomic sequence. In addition, this protein sensor was
      adapted to the Carba-NP assay to provide a rapid strategy to detect
      KPC-producing isolates that will facilitate informed treatment of
      critically ill patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hospital-acquired infections caused by K pneumoniae are
      difficult to eradicate since K pneumoniae carries resistance genes for
      many antimicrobials, including carbapenems. The study aimed to determine
      the prevalence of hospital-acquired infections caused by multiple
      drug-resistant K pneumoniae and identify carbapenem and fluoroquinolone
      resistance by phenotypic and genotypic methods amongst hospitalised
      patients. METHODS: Two hundred and fifty samples from patients with
      hospital-acquired infections were included. Identification and
      susceptibility testing for K pneumoniae isolates was performed by standard
      methods. The detection of carbapenemase resistance (bla(KPC) , bla(VIM-1)
      and bla(OXA-48) ) and plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR; qnrA,
      qnrB and qnrS) genes was performed using PCR assay. RESULTS: Out of 250
      samples, 42 (16.8%) were multiple drug-resistant K pneumoniae, and the
      frequency of K Pneumoniae isolation was higher in urine samples, in the
      age group (<10 years), in ICU and in patients with longer hospital stay.
      Twenty-four (57%) of the isolates were resistant to Meropenem, 13 (31%)
      were resistant to Imipenem and 35 (83.3%) were resistant to Ciprofloxacin.
      bla(OXA-48) gene was detected in 9 (21.4%) of isolates, and bla(VIM-1)
      gene was detected in 6 (14.3%) of isolates. However, no isolate harboured
      bla(KPC) gene. PMQR genes were detected in 100% of ciprofloxacin resistant
      isolates, and qnrS was the dominant. CONCLUSION: Multidrug-resistant K
      pneumoniae isolates harbouring bla(OXA-48,) bla(VIM-1) and PMQR genes are
      emerging in hospitals particularly with long hospital stays.

TI  - Emergence of Hypervirulent Carbapenem-Resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae
      Coharboring a bla(NDM-1)-Carrying Virulent Plasmid and a
      bla(KPC-2)-Carrying Plasmid in an Egyptian Hospital

AB  - The emergence of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP)
      isolates in Egyptian hospitals has been reported. However, the genetic
      basis and analysis of the plasmids associated with carbapenem-resistant
      hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (CR-HvKP) in Egypt have not been presented.
      Therefore, we attempted to decipher the plasmid sequences that are
      responsible for transferring the determinants of carbapenem resistance,
      particularly bla(NDM-1) and bla(KPC-2) Out of 34 K. pneumoniae isolates
      collected from two tertiary hospitals in Egypt, 31 were CRKP. Whole-genome
      sequencing revealed that our isolates were related to 13 different
      sequence types (STs). The most prevalent ST was ST101, followed by ST383
      and ST11. Among the CRKP isolates, one isolate named EBSI036 has been
      reassessed by Nanopore sequencing. Genetic environment analysis showed
      that EBSI036 carried 20 antibiotic resistance genes and was identified as
      a CR-HvKP strain: it harbored four plasmids, namely, pEBSI036-1-NDM-VIR,
      pEBSI036-2-KPC, pEBSI036-3, and pEBSI036-4. The two carbapenemase genes
      bla(NDM-1) and bla(KPC-2) were located on plasmids pEBSI036-1-NDM-VIR and
      pEBSI036-2-KPC, respectively. The IncFIB:IncHI1B hybrid plasmid
      pEBSI036-1-NDM-VIR also carried some virulence factors, including the
      regulator of the mucoid phenotype (rmpA), the regulator of mucoid
      phenotype 2 (rmpA2), and aerobactin (iucABCD and iutA). Thus, we set out
      in this study to analyze in depth the genetic basis of the
      pEBSI036-1-NDM-VIR and pEBSI036-2-KPC plasmids. We report a high-risk
      clone ST11 KL47 serotype of a CR-HvKP strain isolated from the blood of a
      60-year-old hospitalized female patient from the intensive care unit (ICU)
      in a tertiary care hospital in Egypt, which showed the cohabitation of a
      novel hybrid plasmid coharboring the bla(NDM-1) and virulence genes and a
      bla(KPC-2)-carrying plasmid.IMPORTANCE CRKP has been registered in the
      critical priority tier by the World Health Organization and has become a
      significant menace to public health. The emergence of CR-HvKP is of great
      concern in terms of both disease and treatment. In-depth analysis of the
      carbapenemase-encoding and virulence plasmids may provide insight into
      ongoing recombination and evolution of virulence and multidrug resistance
      in K. pneumoniae Thus, this study serves to alert contagious disease
      clinicians to the presence of hypervirulence in CRKP isolates in Egyptian
      hospitals.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Imipenem/relebactam (IMP/R) is a newly FDA
      approved β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination. Relebactam ability to
      restore IMP activity could differ according to the cause of imipenem
      non-susceptibility. Therefore, we investigated the in-vitro activity of
      IMP/R against Klebsiella pneumoniae with different mechanisms of imipenem
      non-susceptibility. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Imipenem-nonsusceptible
      (IMP-NS) K. pneumoniae isolates were collected and characterized for
      β-lactamase encoding genes by multiplex PCR. For IMP-NS
      carbapenemase-negative isolates, study of Ompk35 & Ompk36 gene expression
      was performed by reverse transcription-PCR while efflux pump activity was
      studied by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) reduction assay using
      efflux pump inhibitor. Susceptibility testing of K. pneumoniae to IMP and
      IMP/R were achieved by broth microdilution (BMD) method. RESULTS: During
      the study period, 140 isolates of IMP-NS K. pneumoniae were collected. BMD
      method showed that relebactam restored IMP susceptibility in 100%, 60% and
      49% of isolates that only harbor AmpC, extended spectrum beta lactamase
      (ESBL) and carbapenemases, respectively. IMP/R was most potent against all
      bla (KPC) and 50% of bla (OXA-48) _producing isolates. No demonstrable
      activity of IMP/R against K. pneumoniae harboring metallo-β-lactamases
      (MBLs). Out of 18 isolates with IMP non-suceptibility due to porins loss
      with overproduction of ESBL and/or AmpC, 14 (77.7%) isolates were IMP/R
      susceptible. IMP/R showed no activity against isolates with only efflux
      pump hyperactivity. CONCLUSION: Relebactam could restore IPM activity in
      KPC or AmpC-producing IMP/NS K. pneumoniae but with no activity against
      MBL(-) producing isolates. Relebactam activity against isolates
      harbouring-bla (OXA-48) or with altered Ompk35 & Ompk36 gene expression
      and efflux pump hyperactivity need further studies. Therefore, using IMP/R
      antibiotic in the treatment of infections caused by IMP/NS K. pneumoniae
      should be based on its molecular profile of IMP resistance to optimize the
      utility of IMP/R.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae is a dominant cause of community-acquired and
      nosocomial infections, specifically among immunocompromised individuals.
      The increasing occurrence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates has
      significantly impacted the effectiveness of antimicrobial agents. As
      antibiotic resistance is becoming increasingly prevalent worldwide, the
      use of bacteriophages to treat pathogenic bacterial infections has
      recently gained attention. Elucidating the details of phage-bacteria
      interactions will provide insights into phage biology and the better
      development of phage therapy. In this study, a total of 22 K. pneumoniae
      isolates were assessed for their genetic and phenotypic relatedness by
      multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), endonuclease S1 nuclease pulsed-field
      gel electrophoresis (S1-PFGE), and in vitro antibiotic susceptibility
      testing. In addition, the beta-lactamase gene (bla(KPC)) was characterized
      to determine the spread and outbreak of K. pneumoniae carbapenemase
      (KPC)-producing enterobacterial pathogens. Using these ST11
      carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates, three phages (NL_ZS_1,
      NL_ZS_2, and NL_ZS_3) from the family of Podoviridae were isolated and
      characterized to evaluate the application of lytic phages against the MDR
      K. pneumoniae isolates. In vitro inhibition assays with three phages and
      K. pneumoniae strain ZS15 demonstrated the strong lytic potential of the
      phages, however, followed by the rapid growth of phage-resistant and
      phage-sensitive mutants, suggesting several anti-phage mechanisms had
      developed in the host populations. Together, this data adds more
      comprehensive knowledge to known phage biology and further emphasizes
      their complexity and future challenges to overcome prior to using phages
      for controlling this important MDR bacterium.

AB  - Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) have been rapidly increasing
      among animals in many countries and have been a great threat to public
      health. Horse riding is becoming increasingly popular worldwide; however,
      reports of CRE producing NDM or KPC-2, two prevalent types of
      carbapenemases, from horses of equestrian club are extremely scarce and
      KPC-2-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in animals is still rarely
      characterized. In this study, we identified four NDM-5-producing
      Escherichia coli isolates from horses in equestrian club in Qingdao,
      China, and one horse possessing NDM-5-producing E. coli also carried ST11
      KPC-2-producing K. pneumoniae. Transferability of the plasmids producing
      carbapenemases was determined by conjugation, and the sequences of all CRE
      isolates and their transconjugants were then analysed by using
      whole-genome sequencing. bla(NDM-5) was located on a highly similar ~ 46
      kb self-transmissible IncX3 plasmid in all isolates, and these plasmids
      were nearly identical to IncX3 plasmids from different bacterial species
      of clinical patients in several countries, even including plasmid from
      clinical E. coli in Qingdao, China. The chromosome of the ST11 K.
      pneumoniae in this study was highly similar to ST11 clinical K. pneumoniae
      reported worldwide including the ST11 KPC-2-producing WCHKP020098 from
      Chengdu, China, and the bla(KPC-2) -bearing plasmid in our study was a
      novel F33:A-:B- non-conjugative multidrug resistance plasmid. The presence
      of CRE from horses in equestrian club is alarming due to the potential for
      transmitting these isolates to humans during horse riding, and the
      prevalence of CRE among equestrian clubs in the whole country requires
      further monitoring.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae is a major pathogen implicated in nosocomial
      infections. Extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing K. pneumoniae
      isolates are a public health concern. We aim to characterize the type of
      β-lactamases and the associated resistance mechanisms in ESBL-producing K.
      pneumoniae isolates obtained from blood cultures in a Portuguese hospital,
      as well as to determine the circulating clones. Twenty-two
      cefotaxime/ceftazidime-resistant (CTX/CAZR) K. pneumoniae isolates were
      included in the study. Identification was performed by MALDI-TOF MS and
      the antimicrobial susceptibility testing by disk-diffusion. The screening
      test for ESBL-production was performed and ESBL-producer isolates were
      further characterized. The presence of different beta-lactamase genes
      (blaCTX-M, blaSHV, blaTEM, blaKPC, blaNDM, blaVIM, blaOXA-48, blaCMY-2,
      blaDHA-1, blaFOX, blaMOX, and blaACC) was analyzed by PCR/sequencing in
      ESBL-producer isolates, as well as the presence of other resistance genes
      (aac(6')-Ib-cr, tetA/B, dfrA, qnrA/B/S, sul1/2/3) or integron-related
      genes (int1/2/3). Multilocus-sequence-typing (MLST) was performed for
      selected isolates. ESBL activity was detected in 12 of the 22 CTX/CAZR K.
      pneumoniae isolates and 11 of them carried the blaCTX-M-15 gene (together
      with blaTEM), and the remaining isolate carried the blaSHV-106 gene. All
      the blaCTX-M-15 harboring isolates also contained a blaSHV gene (blaSHV-1,
      blaSHV-11 or blaSHV-27 variants). Both blaSHV-27 and blaSHV-106 genes
      correspond to ESBL-variants. Two of the CTX-M-15 producing isolates
      carried a carbapenemase gene (blaKPC2/3 and blaOXA-48) and showed imipenem
      resistance. The majority of the ESBL-producing isolates carried the int1
      gene, as well as sulphonamide-resistance genes (sul2 and/or sul3); the
      tetA gene was detected in all eight tetracycline-resistant isolates. Three
      different genetic lineages were found in selected isolates: ST348 (one
      CTX-M-15/TEM/SHV-27/KPC-2/3-producer isolate), ST11 (two
      CTX-M-15/TEM/SHV-1- and CTX-M-15-TEM-SHV-11-OXA-48-producer isolates) and
      ST15 (one SHV-106/TEM-producer isolate). ESBL enzymes of CTX-M-15 or
      SHV-type are detected among blood K. pneumoniae isolates, in some cases in
      association with carbapenemases of KPC or OXA-48 type.

AB  - The World Health Organization recently highlighted the serious worldwide
      problem of the emergence of antibiotic-resistant or antibiotic
      multidrug-resistant bacteria. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales,
      including carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE), are major
      antibiotic-resistant bacteria that can be identified by various methods,
      including antibiotic susceptibility testing, PCR, and immunologic assays.
      However, there is a need for a faster, more accurate, low-cost, and easy
      method to detect CPE strains. We previously developed an osmotic shock
      matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (OS-MALDI
      MS) method for directly detecting intact Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenemase (KPC) using osmotic shock cell lysis. In this study, we
      evaluated the OS-MALDI MS method and compared it with two other methods
      (octyl-glucoside-aided direct KPC detection method [OG-MALDI MS] and
      Bruker's MBT subtyping module indirect method [MBT-SM MALDI MS]). We first
      completed an analytical performance evaluation of the OS-MALDI MS method
      according to Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines.
      Clinical testing was performed with 437 clinical isolates, including 292
      KPC-producing bacteria and 145 non-KPC-producing bacteria. The OS-MALDI MS
      method exhibited 95.9% sensitivity, 100.0% specificity, and 100.0%
      precision for detecting KPC. Accuracy of the OS-MALDI MS, OG-MALDI MS, and
      MBT-SM MALDI MS methods was 97.3%, 55.9%, and 50.2%, respectively. In
      conclusion, the OS-MALDI MS method clearly outperformed the other methods,
      exhibiting the highest accuracy and sensitivity of the three methods. We
      propose the OS-MALDI MS method as a practical, useful method for clinic
      environments, which may help guide appropriate antibiotic treatment and
      contribute to the prevention of the spread of CPE.

AB  - Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) has caused wide
      dissemination among pediatric patients globally and thus has aroused
      public concern. Here, we investigated the clinical epidemiological
      characteristics of 140 nonreplicate clinical K. pneumoniae strains
      isolated from pediatric patients between January and December 2021. Of all
      isolates, 16.43% (23 of 140) were CRKP strains, which predominantly
      contained KPC carbapenemase. wzi sequencing demonstrated that KL47
      (65.22%, 15 of 23) was the most frequent capsular type, followed by KL64
      (17.39%, 4 of 23). A total of 23 CRKP strains were classified into three
      different O-genotypes, including OL101 (65.22%, 15 of 23), O1 (26.09%, 6
      of 23), and O3 (8.7%, 2 of 23). Interestingly, KL47 strains were strongly
      associated with OL101, while KL64 strains were all linked with O1. Some
      capsule-deficient strains were identified by serological typing,
      phage-typing, depolymerase-typing, and uronic acid assay. In this study,
      compared with healthy children, higher titers of anti-capsular
      polysaccharides (CPS) IgG were first detected in the sera of K47 and K64
      K. pneumoniae-infected children, which had the effective bactericidal
      activity against corresponding serotype K. pneumoniae strains. These
      findings will facilitate the development of novel therapeutic and vaccine
      strategies against K. pneumoniae infection in children. IMPORTANCE The
      emergence of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) strains
      resistant to numerous antibiotics and the limited therapeutic options
      available have become an urgent health threat to the immunocompromised
      pediatric population. Vaccines and antibodies, especially those targeting
      capsular polysaccharides, may be novel and effective prevention and
      treatment options. Thus, it is important to understand the spread of CRKP
      in pediatric populations. This research presents OL101:KL47 and O1:KL64 as
      the predominant combinations among CRKP strains in children in Shanghai,
      China. The primary carbapenemase gene is KPC in CRKP strains.
      Additionally, this study found elevated levels of anti-CPS IgG against K47
      and K64 K. pneumoniae strains in pediatric patients for the first time.
      The significant bactericidal activity of these anti-CPS IgGs was
      confirmed.

AB  - Background: Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-Kp) is endemic
      globally, causing severe infections in hospitalized patients. Surveillance
      programs help monitor and promptly identify the emergence of new clones.
      We reported the rapid spread of a novel clone of K. pneumoniae
      co-harbouring class A and D carbapenemases in colonized patients, and the
      potential risk factors involved in the development of infections. Methods:
      Rectal swabs were used for microbiological analyses and detection of the
      most common carbapenemase encoding genes by real-time PCR (i.e., blaKPC,
      blaOXA-48, blaNDM, blaVIM, and blaIMP). All strains co-harbouring KPC and
      OXA-48 genes were evaluated. For each patient, the following variables
      were collected: age, sex, length and ward of stay, device use, and
      outcome. Clonality of CR-Kp was assessed by preliminary pulsed field gel
      electrophoresis (PFGE), followed by multi-locus sequence typing (MLST)
      analyses. Results: A total of 127 isolates of K. pneumoniae co-harbouring
      KPC and OXA-48 were collected between September 2019 and December 2020.
      The median age (IQR) of patients was 70 (61-77). More than 40% of patients
      were admitted to intensive care unit (ICU). Around 25% of patients
      developed an invasive infection, the majority of which were respiratory
      tract infections (17/31; 54.8%). ICU stay and invasive infection increased
      the risk of mortality (OR: 5.39, 95% CI: 2.42-12.00; OR 6.12, 95% CI:
      2.55-14.69, respectively; p-value ≤ 0.001). The antibiotic susceptibility
      test showed a resistance profile for almost all antibiotics considered.
      Monoclonal origin was confirmed by PFGE and MLST showing a similar
      restriction pattern and belonging to ST-512. Conclusions: We report the
      spread and the marked antibiotic resistance profiles of K. pneumoniae
      strains co-producing KPC and OXA-48. Further study could clarify the roles
      of clinical and microbiological variables in the development of invasive
      infection and increasing risk of mortality, in colonized patients.

AB  - Resistance to polymyxin antibiotics is increasing. Without new antibiotic
      classes, combination therapy is often required. We systematically
      investigated bacterial killing with polymyxin-based combinations against
      multidrug-resistant (including polymyxin-resistant),
      carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae Monotherapies and double-
      and triple-combination therapies were compared to identify the most
      efficacious treatment using static time-kill studies (24 h, six isolates),
      an in vitro pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model (IVM; 48 h, two
      isolates), and the mouse thigh infection model (24 h, six isolates). In
      static time-kill studies, all monotherapies (polymyxin B, rifampin,
      amikacin, meropenem, or minocycline) were ineffective. Initial bacterial
      killing was enhanced with various polymyxin B-containing double
      combinations; however, substantial regrowth occurred in most cases by 24
      h. Most polymyxin B-containing triple combinations provided greater and
      more sustained killing than double combinations. Standard dosage regimens
      of polymyxin B (2.5 mg/kg of body weight/day), rifampin (600 mg every 12
      h), and amikacin (7.5 mg/kg every 12 h) were simulated in the IVM. Against
      isolate ATH 16, no viable bacteria were detected across 5 to 25 h with
      triple therapy, with regrowth to ∼2-log(10) CFU/ml occurring at 48 h.
      Against isolate BD 32, rapid initial killing of ∼3.5-log(10) CFU/ml at 5 h
      was followed by a slow decline to ∼2-log(10) CFU/ml at 48 h. In infected
      mice, polymyxin B monotherapy (60 mg/kg/day) generally was ineffective.
      With triple therapy (polymyxin B at 60 mg/kg/day, rifampin at 120
      mg/kg/day, and amikacin at 300 mg/kg/day), at 24 h there was an
      ∼1.7-log(10) CFU/thigh reduction compared to the starting inoculum for all
      six isolates. Our results demonstrate that the polymyxin
      B-rifampin-amikacin combination significantly enhanced in vitro and in
      vivo bacterial killing, providing important information for the
      optimization of polymyxin-based combinations in patients.

AB  - Background: Recently, the emergence of carbapenem-resistant
      hypermucoviscous Klebsiella pneumoniae has aroused increasing attention in
      China. We investigated the characteristics of a Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenemase-2 (KPC-2) and New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase-5 (NDM-5)
      coproducing hypermucoviscous K. pneumoniae strain, named RJ-8061, which
      was isolated from the urine of an 86-year-old female patient with
      pneumonia. Methods: The RJ-8061 strain was investigated by string test,
      antimicrobial susceptibility testing, polymerase chain reaction for
      carbapenemase genes detection, capsular genotyping, multilocus sequence
      typing, whole-genome sequencing, and phylogenetics. A serum killing assay
      and a Galleria mellonella infection model were used to evaluate the
      virulence of RJ-8061 in vitro and in vivo. Results: RJ-8061 belonged to
      the sequence type 11 K64 serotype and showed high-level resistance to
      almost all frequently used antibiotics, only remaining susceptible to
      amikacin, colistin, and tigecycline. The complete genome size of RJ-8061
      was 6,106,028 bp, including a 5,394,921 bp chromosome and seven circular
      plasmids. Plasmid pRJ-8061-hybrid is a 294,249 bp hybrid plasmid that
      co-harbored resistance genes [bla(TEM-1B), mph(A), aac(3)-IId] and
      virulence genes (iucABCDiutA, rmpA2), whereas rmpA2 is a truncated
      version. In addition, bla(KPC-2) and bla(NDM-5) were located on plasmids
      171,321 bp pRJ-8061-KPC-2 (IncFII/IncR) and 46,161 bp pRJ-8061-NDM-5
      (IncX3), respectively. K-mer-based phylogenetic analysis grouped RJ-8061
      into a carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae cluster. The G.
      mellonella infection model revealed that RJ-8061 showed relatively low
      virulence, with a 50% lethal dose of 10(6) cfu. Conclusions: To the best
      of our knowledge, this is the first report of a hypermucoviscous K.
      pneumoniae coproducing KPC-2 and NDM-5 carbapenemases.

AB  - Aim: Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-Kp) strains are
      important nosocomial pathogens worldwide. In this study, we aimed to
      reveal the antibiotic resistance of clinical CR-Kp strains and determine
      the presence of KPC, OXA-48, VIM and IMP carbapenemase genes. CTX-M-1,
      TEM-1, SHV-1 extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) genes, qnrA, qnrB,
      qnrS plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance genes and sul1 and sul2
      sulfonamide resistance genes provided molecular epidemiological data.
      Methods: A total of 175 K. pneumoniae strains were isolated from clinical
      samples of patients hospitalised in an intensive care unit (ICU) betweent
      April and October 2017. The strains were identified with conventional
      methods, with VITEK 2 (BioMerieux, France) and MALDI-TOF MS (Bruker, USA).
      Antimicrobial susceptibilities were tested using the disc-diffusion method
      and E-test (BioMerieux, France). Antimicrobial resistance genes were
      investigated via real-time PCR in strains identified as CR-Kp. Results:
      High frequencies of bla (TEM-1) (86.36%), bla (SHV-1) (86.36%), and bla
      (CTX-M-1) (95.45%) genes were found in CR-Kp strains. Morever, all three
      ESBL genes coexisted in 77.3% of all strains. bla (KPC) was detected in 12
      (54.55%) of the strains, and 4 of them which had an MIC> 16 μg/mL to
      imipenem showed bla (OXA-48) positivity as well. The qnrS gene determinant
      (86.36%) had the highest frequency, and strains carrying qnrA showed
      higher MICs for ciprofloxacin. Conclusion: CR-Kp strains are able to
      develop different antimicrobial resistance patterns according to regional
      changes in antimicrobial therapeutic policies. Thus, it is important to
      monitor the regional molecular epidemiological data for efficient
      treatment.

AB  - Treatment strategies of infection by carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella
      pneumoniae (CRKP) are limited. Fosfomycin, a broad-spectrum antibiotic,
      has attracted renewed interest in combination therapy to fight K.
      pneumoniae infections. However, reports on fosfomycin-resistant K.
      pneumoniae are increasing. Among the 57 CRKP strains, 40 (70.2%) were
      resistant to fosfomycin. Thus, whole-genome sequencing and bioinformatics
      analysis were conducted to reveal molecular characteristics of
      fosfomycin-resistant K. pneumoniae. Twenty-three isolates coharbored fosA
      (kp) and fosA3, with K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing
      ST11-KL64-wzi64-O2 (n = 13) and ST11-KL47-wzi209-OL101 (n = 8), the
      predominating clonal groups, while fosA3 was not detected in isolates
      carrying class B carbapenemase genes. Twenty-two (out of 26) ST11-KL64
      strains were positive for rmpA2, of which 12 carried fosA3. Four of the 23
      fosA3-positive isolates could successfully transfer their
      fosfomycin-resistant determinants to Escherichia coli J53Azi (R) . All
      four strains belonged to ST11-KL47 with the same pulsed-field gel
      electrophoresis profile, and their transconjugants acquired fosfomycin,
      carbapenem, and aminoglycoside resistance. A 127-kb conjugative
      pCT-KPC-like hybrid plasmid (pJNKPN52_KPC_fosA) coharboring fosA3, bla
      (KPC-2), bla (CTX-M-65), bla (SHV-12), rmtB, and bla (TEM-1) was
      identified. ST11-KL64 and ST11-KL47 K. pneumoniae, with higher resistance
      and virulence, should be critically monitored to prevent the future
      dissemination of resistance.

AB  - Current knowledge suggests that infection by carbapenem-resistant
      enterobacteria is preceded by gut colonization. It is hypothesized that
      colonization is eradicated by non-absorbable antibiotics like rifaximin.
      We investigated the effect of rifaximin against carbapenem-resistant
      Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) in vitro and in a mouse model. We studied the
      in vitro efficacy of rifaximin against 257 CRKP clinical isolates, 188 KPC
      producers and 69 OXA-48 producers, by minimum inhibitory concentration and
      time-kill assays. We then developed a model of gut colonization by feeding
      30 C57Bl6 mice with 10(8) cfu of one KPC-KP isolate for 7 days; mice were
      pre-treated orally with saline, omeprazole or ampicillin. Then, another 60
      mice with established KPC-2 gut colonization received orally for 7
      consecutive days rifaximin 180 mg/kg dissolved in ethanol and 4% bile or
      vehicle. On days 0, 3 and 7 stool samples were collected; mice were
      sacrificed for determination of tissue outgrowth. At a concentration of
      1000 μg/ml rifaximin inhibited 84.8% of CRKP isolates. Α 3 × log(10)
      decrease of the starting inoculum was achieved by 100, 250 and 500 μg/ml
      of rifaximin after 24 h against 25, 55 and 55% of isolates. Pre-treatment
      with ampicillin was necessary for gut colonization by KPC-KP. Treatment
      with rifaximin succeeded in reducing KPC-KP load in stool and in the
      intestine. Rifaximin inhibits at clinically meaningful gut concentrations
      the majority of CRKP isolates and is efficient against gut colonization by
      KPC-KP.

AB  - The study aimed to analyze antibiotic resistance determinants in a
      carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae by whole-genome sequencing
      (WGS). K. pneumoniae was isolated from a urine sample and it was
      characterized by 16S rDNA sequencing in Turkey. This strain was named as
      Kpn Rize-53-TR. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed for
      seventeen antibiotics by VITEK-2 and the result was confirmed by MIC. The
      whole genome of isolate was sequenced by Illumina and was analysed by
      bioinformatic tools for MLST, replicon types, and antimicrobial resistance
      genes. The whole genome data was submitted to NCBI. The isolate was found
      to be resistant to all tested β-lactam antibiotics and the highest MIC
      values were found for piperacillin, piperacillin/tazobactam (≥128). No
      resistance to colistin and moderate susceptibility to amikacin and
      tetracycline was observed. The isolate carried 12 resistance genes
      belonging to 10 resistance classes; ere(A), fosA, oqxB, cmlA1, aac(a)-IIa,
      bla KPC-2, bla TEM-1A, bla SHV-67, bla CTX-M-15, bla OXA-1-2-9. Mutations
      were detected in gyrA (83Y) and parC (80I) genes. Clonal subtype of the
      isolate was ST147, and it had wzi420 and wzc38 alleles. Its serotype was
      O3/O3a. The bla KPC-2 was firstly found in both ST147 clonal group in
      Turkey and in serotype O3/O3a in the world. By plasmid replicon typing,
      five plasmids IncFII(K), Col(BS512), IncR, IncFIA(HI1) and IncFIB(pQil)
      were determined in Kpn Rize-53-TR and bla KPC-2 was located on IncFII(K)
      plasmid. The presence of bla KPC-2 on the plasmid with other resistance
      genes accelerates its own spread together with other resistance genes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To characterize carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae
      isolated from patients treated at a hospital in Cumaná, Sucre, Venezuela.
      METHODS: This was a retrospective study conducted at the general hospital
      in Cumaná where 58 K. pneumoniae strains were analyzed for resistance to
      antimicrobials, specifically carbapenems, in January - June 2015.
      Production of metallo-β-lactamases and serine carbapenemases was
      determined by the double-disc synergy test, using EDTA-sodium
      mercaptoacetic acid and 3-aminophenyl boronic acid discs, respectively.
      Multiplex-PCR was used to detect genes coding for carbapenemases.
      Molecular typing using ERIC-PCR determined the presence of clones.
      RESULTS: Four strains of K. pneumoniae resistant to carbapenems were
      identified. Phenotypic methods for detection of metallo-β-lactamases and
      serine carbapenemases were positive, and PCR demonstrated the co-presence
      of bla (NDM) and bla (KPC) genes in all four strains. ERIC-PCR identified
      two clones circulating in the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: Infection control
      strategies are needed at the central hospital in Cumaná and its
      surrounding areas to prevent the spread of these pathogens, especially
      given the high levels of migration from Venezuela to other countries in
      South America.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae
      (CR-hvKP) is increasingly reported worldwide, but ceftazidime/avibactam
      (CAZ/AVI)-resistant hvKP isolates have rarely been observed. We attempted
      to characterize them in clinical CRKP isolates collected from a university
      hospital in China from March 2016 to March 2018. METHODS: All isolates
      were analyzed by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, molecular detection
      of antibiotic resistance determinants, multilocus sequence typing (MLST),
      SDS-PAGE, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). The pLVPK-related
      genetic loci (rmpA2, terW, iutA, and silS) were screened in all
      CAZ/AVI-resistant CRKP isolates for the presence of virulence plasmids by
      PCR. Capsule typing, serum killing assay, Galleria mellonella lethality
      experiments, and mouse lethality assay were conducted to identify
      CAZ/AVI-resistant hvKP among isolates that carried all four virulence
      genes. RESULTS: A total of 232 CRKP isolates were collected. Overall,
      CAZ/AVI-resistance was found in 8.2% (19/232) CRKP isolates isolated from
      patients with no history of previous CAZ/AVI-based treatment. Among these,
      63.2% (12/19) were metallo-β-lactamase-producing K. pneumoniae (MBL-KP),
      52.6% (10/19) were Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K.
      pneumoniae (KPC-KP), and 26.3% (5/19) produced both MBL and KPC. The
      presence of carbapenemase promoted a very high increase in CAZ/AVI minimum
      inhibitory concentration only when ompk35 and ompk36 were absent.
      Alarmingly, nine isolates had all four virulence genes for the presence of
      virulence plasmids. All nine isolates were considered to be
      CAZ/AVI-resistant hvKP according to the G. mellonella infection model and
      mouse lethality assay, with ST23 being the most common type (55.6%, 5/9).
      CONCLUSION: The newly emerged hypervirulent CAZ/AVI-resistant KP strain
      might cause a serious threat to public health, suggesting an urgent need
      for enhanced clinical awareness and epidemiologic surveillance.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this study was to characterize the molecular
      mechanisms of carbapenem resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae isolated from
      the urology department of Annaba hospital, Algeria. Methods: Between
      January 2015 and September 2017, 14 carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae
      strains were isolated during routine surveillance work at Ibn Roched
      hospital of Annaba, Algeria, from the urology department. Theses strains
      were recovered, and carbapenem resistance mechanisms were investigated.
      The strains were identified by using matrix-assisted laser desorption and
      ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. Antibiotic susceptibility was
      assessed by using the Kirby-Bauer method, whereas minimum inhibitory
      concentration of imipenem/ertapenem and colistin was determined by Etest
      and broth microdilution methods, respectively. Carbapenem resistance
      determinants were studied by using PCR and sequencing methods and analyzed
      by BLAST against the Antibiotic Resistance Gene-ANNOTation (ARG-ANNOT)
      database. Clonal relationship of strains was performed by using multilocus
      sequence typing (MLST). Transferability of carbapenem resistance genes was
      assessed by conjugation and transformation experiments. Results: Fourteen
      carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates were found to be resistant to
      the eight β-lactam antibiotics tested (except to imipenem for two
      isolates). Carbapenemase production was positive for all isolates.
      Molecular characterization revealed that bla(KPC-2) and bla(OXA-48) genes
      were detected in 3 (21.4%) and 11 isolates (78.6%), respectively. Other
      β-lactamases genes were identified, including bla(CTX-M-15), bla(SHV-1-or
      12), and bla(TEM-1). MLST revealed that the 14 isolates belonged to 2
      different sequence types (STs), including ST101 (11 OXA-48-producing K.
      pneumoniae) and ST258 (3 KPC-2-producing K. pneumoniae). PCR
      amplifications for bla(KPC-2) and bla(OXA-48) carbapenemases genes
      performed on extracted plasmids, showed positive results, suggesting that
      both carbapenemase genes were probably borne by plasmids. Conclusion: We
      report here the first identification of KPC-2-producing K. pneumoniae
      ST258 in Algerian hospitals and an outbreak of OXA-48-producing K.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae (KPC-KP)
      have disseminated worldwide and emerged as major threats to public health.
      Of epidemiological significance, the international pandemic of KPC-KP is
      primarily associated with CG258 isolates and bla(KPC)-IncF plasmids.
      CRISPR-Cas system is an adaptive immune system that can hinder gene
      expansion driven by horizontal gene transfer. Because of bla(KPC)-IncF
      plasmids are favored by CG258 K. pneumoniae, it was of interest to examine
      the co-distribution of CRISPR and bla(KPC)-IncF plasmids in such isolates.
      We collected 459 clinical K. pneumoniae isolates in China and collected
      203 global whole-genome sequences in GenBank to determine the prevalence
      of CRISPR-Cas systems. We observed that CRISPR-Cas system was
      significantly scarce in the CG258 lineage and bla(KPC)-positive isolates.
      Furthermore, the results of conjugation and plasmid stability assay fully
      demonstrated the CRIPSR-Cas system in K. pneumoniae could effectively
      hindered bla(KPC)-IncF plasmids invasion and existence. Notably, most
      bla(KPC)-IncF plasmids were also proved to be good targets of CRISPR owing
      to carry matched and functional protospacers and PAMs. Overall, our work
      suggests that type I-E CRISPR-Cas systems could impact the spread of
      bla(KPC) in K. pneumoniae populations, and the scarcity of CRISPR-Cas
      system was one of potential factors leading to the propagation of
      bla(KPC)-IncF plasmids in CG258 K. pneumoniae.

AB  - Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) is an important
      bacterium of nosocomial infections. In this study, CRKP strains, which
      were mainly isolated from fecal samples of 14 patients in three wards of
      the hospital in the Silesia Voivodship, rapidly increased from February to
      August 2018. Therefore, we conducted microbiological and molecular studies
      of the CRKP isolates analyzed. Colonized patients had critical underlying
      diseases and comorbidities; one developed bloodstream infection, and five
      died (33.3%). Antibiotic susceptibilities were determined by the E-test
      method. A disc synergy test confirmed carbapenemase production. CTX-Mplex
      PCR evaluated the presence of resistance genes bla (CTX-M-type), bla
      (CTX-M-1), bla (CTX-M-9), and the genes bla (SHV), bla (TEM), bla (KPC-2),
      bla (NDM-1), bla (OXA-48), bla (IMP), and bla (VIM-1) was detected with
      the PCR method. Clonality was evaluated by Multi Locus Sequence Typing
      (MLST) and Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE). Six (40%) strains were
      of XDR (Extensively Drug-Resistant) phenotype, and nine (60%) of the
      isolates exhibited MDR (Multidrug-Resistant) phenotype. The range of
      carbapenem minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs, μg/mL) was as follows
      doripenem (16 to >32), ertapenem (> 32), imipenem (4 to > 32), and
      meropenem (> 32). PCR and sequencing confirmed the bla (CTX-M-15), bla
      (KPC-2), bla (OXA-48), and bla (VIM-1) genes in all strains. The isolates
      formed one large PFGE cluster (clone A). MLST assigned them to the
      emerging high-risk clone of ST147 (CC147) pandemic lineage harboring the
      bla (OXA-48) gene. This study showed that the K. pneumoniae isolates
      detected in the multi-profile medical centre in Katowice represented a
      single strain of the microorganism spreading in the hospital environment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous studies showed that the epidemic of
      carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-KP) observed in Italy since
      2010 was sustained mostly by strains of clonal group (CG) 258 producing
      KPC-type carbapenemases. In the framework of the National
      Antibiotic-Resistance Surveillance (AR-ISS), a countrywide survey was
      conducted in 2016 to explore the evolution of the phenotypic and genotypic
      characteristics of CR-KP isolates. METHODS: From March to July 2016,
      hospital laboratories participating in AR-ISS were requested to provide
      consecutive, non-duplicated CR-KP (meropenem and/or imipenem MIC >1 mg/L)
      from invasive infections. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined
      according to EUCAST recommendations. A WGS approach was adopted to
      characterize the isolates by investigating phylogeny, resistome and
      virulome. RESULTS: Twenty-four laboratories provided 157 CR-KP isolates,
      of which 156 were confirmed as K. pneumoniae sensu stricto by WGS and
      found to carry at least one carbapenemase-encoding gene, corresponding in
      most cases (96.1%) to blaKPC. MLST- and SNP-based phylogeny revealed that
      87.8% of the isolates clustered in four major lineages: CG258 (47.4%),
      with ST512 as the most common clone, CG307 (19.9%), ST101 (15.4%) and
      ST395 (5.1%). A close association was identified between lineages and
      antibiotic resistance phenotypes and genotypes, virulence traits and
      capsular types. Colistin resistance, mainly associated with mgrB
      mutations, was common in all major lineages except ST395. CONCLUSIONS:
      This WGS-based survey showed that, although CG258 remained the most common
      CR-KP lineage in Italy, a polyclonal population has emerged with the
      spread of the new high-risk lineages CG307, ST101 and ST395, while KPC
      remained the most common carbapenemase.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To characterize genomes of Klebsiella pneumoniae ST11 NDM-1
      responsible for a countrywide outbreak in Poland and compare them
      phylogenetically with other Polish and international ST11 strains.
      METHODS: Seventy-one carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae ST11 isolates
      from Poland, including 66 representatives of the NDM-1 epidemic from
      2012-18, were sequenced using Illumina MiSeq. Additionally, three outbreak
      isolates were also sequenced using MinION. The clonality and phylogenetic
      analysis was done by core-genome MLST and SNP approaches. Resistomes,
      virulomes, K/O antigens and plasmid replicons were screened for. The
      detailed plasmid analysis was based on full assemblies using Oxford
      Nanopore Technologies data. RESULTS: Chromosomes of the outbreak isolates
      formed an essentially homogeneous cluster (though accumulating SNPs
      gradually with time), differing remarkably from other Polish NDM-1/-5-,
      KPC-2- or OXA-48-producing K. pneumoniae ST11 strains. The cluster
      belonged to a clade with 72 additional isolates identified worldwide,
      including closely related NDM-1 producers from several countries,
      including organisms from Bulgaria and Greece. All these had KL24 and O2v1
      antigens and the chromosomal yersiniabactin locus YbST230 residing in the
      ICEKp11 element. The specific blaNDM-1-carrying Tn125 transposon
      derivative, named Tn125A, was located in IncFII/pKPX-1- and/or IncR-like
      plasmids; however, the IncRs rearranged extensively during the outbreak,
      contributing to highly dynamic plasmid profiles and resistomes.
      CONCLUSIONS: The K. pneumoniae ST11 NDM-1 genotype that has been expanding
      in Poland since 2012 is largely monoclonal and represents a novel
      international high-risk lineage that is also spreading in other countries.

      isolates detected between October 2015 and March 2017.
      Clinical-epidemiological and microbiological data were gathered on risk
      factors associated with infection by this clone. Antimicrobial
      susceptibility was determined using MicroScan system and diffusion in
      agar. Genes encoding carbapenemases were detected using PCR and Sanger
      sequencing. The sequence type was assigned by MLST, and the genetic
      relationship among clinical isolates was determined by pulsed field
      electrophoresis and by analysis of the genetic environment. The study
      included 23 individuals with isolates of KPC-3/ST258; the mean age was 77
      year, and mean stay pre-isolation was 32 days; 81% received empirical
      antimicrobial treatment. Isolates were only susceptible to gentamicin (CIM
      ≤ 2 mg/L), tigecycline (CIM ≤ 1 mg/L), and colistin (CIM ≤ 2 mg/L). The
      isolates belonged to ST258, with five pulse types or subgroups. All
      isolates showed amplification of KPC, which was identified as KPC-3
      variant. Gene (blaKPC-3) was flanked by insertion sequences Kpn6 and Kpn7
      within Tn4401 transposon isoform a. We report, for the first time in
      Spain, an 18-month outbreak by KPC-3-producing ST258 K. pneumoniae. Its
      acquisition was associated with a history of antimicrobial therapy, with
      three treatment options, and with high mortality. The detection of
      different pulse types is attributable to different introductions of the
      clone in our setting, supporting the need for multi-resistant isolate
      surveillance studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Infections caused by KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp)
      are associated with high mortality. Therefore, new treatment options are
      urgently required. OBJECTIVES: To assess the outcomes and predictors of
      mortality in patients with KPC- or OXA-48-Kp infections treated with
      ceftazidime/avibactam with an emphasis on KPC-Kp bloodstream infections
      (BSIs). METHODS: A multicentre prospective observational study was
      conducted between January 2018 and March 2019. Patients with KPC- or
      OXA-48-Kp infections treated with ceftazidime/avibactam were included in
      the analysis. The subgroup of patients with KPC-Kp BSIs treated with
      ceftazidime/avibactam was matched by propensity score with a cohort of
      patients whose KPC-Kp BSIs had been treated with agents other than
      ceftazidime/avibactam with in vitro activity. RESULTS: One hundred and
      forty-seven patients were identified; 140 were infected with KPC producers
      and 7 with OXA-48 producers. For targeted therapy, 68 (46.3%) patients
      received monotherapy with ceftazidime/avibactam and 79 (53.7%) patients
      received ceftazidime/avibactam in combination with at least another active
      agent. The 14 and 28 day mortality rates were 9% and 20%, respectively.
      The 28 day mortality among the 71 patients with KPC-Kp BSIs treated with
      ceftazidime/avibactam was significantly lower than that observed in the 71
      matched patients, whose KPC-Kp BSIs had been treated with agents other
      than ceftazidime/avibactam (18.3% versus 40.8%; P = 0.005). In the Cox
      proportional hazards model, ultimately fatal disease, rapidly fatal
      disease and Charlson comorbidity index ≥2 were independent predictors of
      death, whereas treatment with ceftazidime/avibactam-containing regimens
      was the only independent predictor of survival. CONCLUSIONS:
      Ceftazidime/avibactam appears to be an effective treatment against serious
      infections caused by KPC-Kp.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae is an opportunistic pathogen causing nosocomial and
      community-acquired infections. Klebsiella has developed resistance against
      antimicrobials including the last resort class; carbapenem. Currently,
      treatment options for carbapenem-resistant-Klebsiella (CRK) are very
      limited. This study aims to restore carbapenem effectiveness against CRK
      using celastrol and thymol. Clinical Klebsiella isolates were identified
      using biochemical and molecular methods. Antimicrobial susceptibility was
      determined using disk-diffusion method. Carbapenemase-production was
      tested phenotypically and genotypically. Celastrol and thymol-MICs were
      determined and the carbapenemase-inhibitory effect of sub-MICs was
      investigated. Among 85 clinical Klebsiella isolates, 72 were
      multi-drug-resistant and 43 were meropenem-resistant. Phenotypically, 39
      isolates were carbapenemase-producer. Genotypically, bla(NDM1) was
      detected in 35 isolates, bla(VIM) in 17 isolates, bla(OXA) in 18 isolates,
      and bla(KPC) was detected only in 6 isolates. Celastrol showed significant
      inhibitory effect against carbapenemase-hydrolytic activity. Meropenem-MIC
      did not decrease in presence of celastrol, only 2-fold decrease was
      observed with thymol, while 4-64 fold decrease was observed when meropenem
      was combined with both celastrol and thymol. Furthermore, thymol increased
      CRK cell wall-permeability. Molecular docking revealed that celastrol is
      superior to thymol for binding to KPC and VIM-carbapenemase. Our study
      showed that celastrol is a promising inhibitor of multiple carbapenemases.
      While meropenem-MIC were not affected by celastrol alone and decreased by
      only 2-folds with thymol, it decreased by 4-64 folds in presence of both
      celastrol and thymol. Thymol increases the permeability of CRK-envelope to
      celastrol. The triple combination (meropenem/celastrol/thymol) could be
      useful for developing more safe and effective analogues to restore the
      activity of meropenem and other β-lactams.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the molecular mechanisms of ceftazidime/avibactam
      (CAZ/AVI) resistance in six Klebsiella pneumoniae strains that co-produce
      K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-2 and a novel variant of CMY
      cephalosporinase in a Chinese hospital. METHODS: Antimicrobial
      susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution. Whole-genome
      sequencing (WGS) was performed to investigate potential resistance
      determinants. Plasmid conjugation, electroporation, S1 nuclease
      pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (S1-PFGE) hybridization and cloning
      experiment were carried out to investigate the resistance plasmids and
      genes. RESULTS: A high level of CAZ/AVI resistance was observed in six
      KPC-Kp strains (MIC 128 mg/L). Five strains were isolated in 2015 and one
      in 2016, before the approval of CAZ/AVI in China. Sequence analysis
      indicated that all the strains belonged to sequence type (ST) 11 and
      uniformly carried a novel CMY AmpC β-lactamase gene, designated
      bla(CMY-172). When compared with CMY-2, CMY-172 has a deletion of three
      consecutive amino acids (K290, V291 and A292) in the R2-loop region and a
      non-synonymous amino acid substitution at position 346 (N(346)I). The
      bla(CMY-172)-bearing plasmid, pKPCZA02_4, was 93.3 Kb, IncI1-I type, and
      conjugative; bla(CMY-172) was located in an IS1294-mediated transposon.
      Plasmid conjugation and DNA fragment cloning proved that bla(CMY-172) was
      responsible for CAZ/AVI resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Our study identified
      conjugative plasmid-mediated bla(CMY-172) as a new mechanism for CAZ/AVI
      resistance in clinical KPC-Kp strains. Careful monitoring of CAZ/AVI
      susceptibility is imperative for preventing the spread of the resistance
      gene.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae is one of the most common Gram-negative bacilli
      isolated from bloodstream infections worldwide, and recently an increased
      rate of carbapenem resistance has been reported in this pathogen. This
      study aims to describe the genomic characteristics of carbapenem-resistant
      K. pneumoniae (CRKP) isolated from patients with bacteremia in China. We
      analyzed 147 isolates from patients with bacteremia attended in 12
      referral hospitals in China between April 2015 and November 2018. We
      conducted a phenotypic susceptibility evaluation and whole genome sequence
      analysis to characterize antimicrobial resistance profile, virulence
      genes, and dominant clones among CRKP. ST11 accounted for most infections
      (n = 98, 66.6%), followed by ST45 (n = 12, 8.2%), ST15 and ST290 (n = 8,
      5.4% each). KPC (n = 98, 66.7%) and NDM (n = 27, 18.4%) are the main
      carbapenemases detected in the CRKP isolates. We detected yersiniabactin
      (n = 123, 83.7%) and aerobactin (49.9%) siderophores, and both rmpA and
      aerobactin genes in 21 ST11 isolates (21.43%), which are considered
      characteristic biomarkers of hypervirulent strains. Isolates showed high
      resistance rates to the β-lactams (>90%) and other antibiotics classes
      such as fluoroquinolones, aminoglycosides and tetracyclines (50%), but
      were susceptible to ceftazidime-avibactam (74.8%). In addition, we
      detected intra-hospital transmission of ST11 and ST45 strains in single
      and multiple wards in several hospitals, whereas inter-hospital
      transmission was relatively uncommon. In summary, we observed
      significantly genomic diversity of CRKP bacteremia isolates in China,
      although KPC-2 producing ST11 strains were found to be the most common
      clonal types. Reducing intra-hospital transmission remains to be the key
      to control CRKP caused bloodstream infections in China. IMPORTANCE K.
      pneumoniae is one of the most frequent Gram-negative bacilli isolated from
      bloodstream infections worldwide and recent studies have shown an
      increased rate of carbapenem resistance in China. Among
      carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP) diverse clones have been
      reported, especially the high-risk clone ST11, which also exhibited a
      multidrug resistant phenotype. In addition to the antimicrobial
      resistance, previous studies have detected strains co-harboring virulent
      traits, highlighting the potential of transmission of both antimicrobial
      resistant and virulent strains. Here we studied the antimicrobial
      resistance profile, virulence genes and hospital transmission of CRKP from
      bacteremic patients in China. This study showed a high clonal diversity
      among CRKP, with the predominance of ST11 lineages. We detected virulence
      markers among multidrug resistant strains, and a high number of
      genetically similar isolates, suggesting intra-hospital transmission
      within single and multiple wards. Reducing intra-hospital transmission
      remains to be the key to control CRKP caused bacteremia in China.

AB  - PURPOSE: The continuous emergence of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella
      pneumoniae (CRKP) has become a serious public health problem globally,
      especially for children, but data on CRKP infection in pediatric patients
      are limited. This study aimed to identify epidemiological and molecular
      patterns of CRKP among pediatric patients in Jiangsu province, China.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: CRKP were consecutively collected from the
      Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University in China from July 2018
      to May 2019. Then, CRKP strains were performed for further study:
      antimicrobial susceptibility testing, drug-resistance determinants
      screening and homology analysis. RESULTS: We collected 94 CRKP from 94
      children. Overall, bla (KPC-2) (79.8%) was the predominant carbapenemase
      gene, followed by bla (NDM-1)(14.9%), bla (IMP-4) (5.3%) and bla
      (NDM-5)(4.3%). Notably, two isolates coharbored bla (KPC-2) and bla
      (IMP-4), and two isolates coharbored bla (KPC-2) and bla (NDM-5). MLST
      analysis revealed that 14 distinct sequence types (STs) were identified,
      of which ST11 was the most common sequence type identified. Moreover, two
      novel STs, ST4854 and ST4855, were detected in this study. PFGE revealed
      that a predominant cluster consisting of KPC-2-producing CRKP ST11 clone
      isolates was identified and was distributed mainly in the pediatric
      intensive care unit (PICU) and cardiac intensive care unit (CCU).
      Moreover, this is the first report to identify the dissemination of ST716
      CRKP coproducing KPC-2 and IMP-4 clones. CONCLUSION: Clonal dissemination
      of KPC-2-producing CRKP ST11 was observed in multiple departments.
      Moreover, two novel STs (ST4854 and ST4855) were identified, which
      indicates an increased diversity of CRKP strains. To our knowledge, this
      is the first report that identified the dissemination of Klebsiella
      pneumoniae coproducing KPC-2 and IMP-4 clones among children, which
      represents a significant health risk to pediatric patients. Active
      surveillance and effective control measures are urgently needed to prevent
      further transmission of these strains among children.

      pneumoniae and inhibit bacterial growth in vitro. The inhibitory effect on
      gyrA gene was evaluated by measuring 16s gene amplification in
      KPC-producing K. pneumoniae treated with the antisense PNA conjugate. The
      hemolytic property of the antisense PNA conjugate was accessed toward mice
      red blood cells. Finally, molecular modeling and dynamics simulations
      analyses in aqueous solutions were performed to predict the PNA
      conformation alone in contact with DNA (gyrA gene sequence). PNA was
      capable of inhibiting bacterial growth at 50 μM, also reducing 16S gene
      amplification in 96.7%. Besides, PNA presented low hemolytic activity
      (21.1% hemolysis) at this same concentration. Bioinformatics analysis
      demonstrated that the structure of the PNA is stable in water without
      major changes in its secondary structure. The ability of PNA and its
      conjugated CPP ((KFF)3K) to inhibit bacterial growth demonstrates the
      potential of this new class of antibacterial agents, encouraging further
      in vivo studies to confirm its therapeutic efficacy.

AB  - The objective of this study was to utilize a co-culture hollow-fiber
      infection model (HFIM) to characterize the interplay between a small,
      difficult-to-detect, New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase-producing Klebsiella
      pneumoniae (NDM-Kp) minor population and a larger K. pneumoniae
      carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae population in the presence of
      KPC-directed antibacterial therapy. Selective plating onto agar with
      ceftazidime-avibactam was used to track the density of the NDM-Kp
      population. Susceptibility testing and the Verigene System failed to
      identify the small initial NDM-Kp population. However, a
      ceftazidime-avibactam Etest detected resistant colonies that were
      confirmed to be NDM-Kp. In the HFIM, all of the investigated drug regimens
      caused regrowth within 24 h and resulted in >10(9) CFU/mL of NDM-Kp. Our
      study demonstrates that the HFIM is a powerful tool for studying the
      population dynamics of multiple pathogens during antimicrobial exposure
      and also highlights that difficult-to-detect minor populations of
      drug-resistant bacteria may cause treatment failure without appropriate
      antibacterial therapy.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The clinical characteristics and microbiological data of
      patients with K. pneumoniae bloodstream infections (BSI) from January 2018
      to December 2020 were retrospectively analyzed to study the molecular
      epidemiology of Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP). We also
      aimed to identify the risk factors for the development of CRKP BSI.
      METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted at Renmin Hospital of
      Wuhan University from January 2018 to December 2020. The date of
      non-duplicate K. pneumoniae isolates isolated from blood samples was
      identified using the microbiology laboratory database. The data from
      patients diagnosed with K. pneumoniae BSI were collected and analyzed.
      RESULTS: From 2018 to 2020, there were 510 non-duplicated K. pneumoniae
      blood isolates, mainly distributed in the intensive care unit (ICU)
      (28.4%), that were identified in our research. These cases included 77
      strains of CRKP and 433 strains of carbapenem-susceptible K. pneumoniae
      (CSKP). The resistance rate of K. pneumoniae to meropenem and imipenem
      increased from 11.2% in 2018 to 27.1% in 2020. Moreover, Compared with
      CSKP, all CRKP isolates showed multi-resistance to tested antibiotics. The
      phylogenetic analysis showed that the CRKP isolates could be grouped into
      four major clades, and multilocus sequence typing revealed that the
      isolates had considerable clonality. Overall, 8 sequence types (STs) of
      CRKP were detected, of which ST11 comprised the majority and clustered
      into clade 3. The most prevalent carbapenemase gene was bla(KPC) (87%)
      among the CRKP isolates, followed by bla(NDM) (9.1%) and bla(IMP) (1.3%).
      A total of 74 (16.6%) patients with CRKP BSI and 373 (83.4%) patients with
      CSKP BSI were categorized as the case and control groups. The mortality in
      the CRKP group was 44.6%, and 11.5% in CSKP group (P<0.001). A
      multivariate analysis that a long hospital stay before BSI (OR=1.42, 95%
      CI 1.02-4.31, P=0.011), ICU hospitalization history (OR=3.30, 95% CI
      1.35-8.05, P=0.002), and prior use of carbapenems (OR=3.33, 95% CI
      1.29-7.27, P=0.001) and antifungals (OR=2.81, 95% CI 1.24-6.04, P<0.001)
      were independent risk factors for CRKP BSI. CONCLUSION: ST11 is the
      predominant type of CRKP mediating inter-hospital transmission, and
      bla(KPC) is the main carbapenemase gene harboured by CRKP blood isolates.
      ICU stay, prolonged hospitalization before BSI, and prior use of
      carbapenems and antifungals were independent risk factors for acquiring
      CRKP BSI. Our study may provide insights into early infection control
      practices.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales are a global problem,
      however little is known about the burden and origin of carbapenem
      resistance in Africa. The objectives of this study were to determine the
      proportion of carbapenem-resistant isolates among extended-spectrum
      β-lactamase-producing Enterobacterales (ESBL-E), to identify the
      underlying mechanisms of resistance and to assess the population structure
      of carbapenem-resistant isolates from Nigeria. METHODS: ESBL-E isolates (n
      = 175) from infections were collected at four hospitals in Lagos, Nigeria,
      from July 2016 to January 2018 and were screened for carbapenem resistance
      using a VITEK®2 automated system. All carbapenem-resistant ESBL-E (CRE)
      were screened for bla(KPC), bla(CTX-M), bla(CMY-2), bla(NDM), bla(VIM),
      bla(IMP), bla(OXA-181) and bla(OXA-48) genes. Genotyping of randomly
      selected isolates was performed by whole-genome sequencing. RESULTS: The
      isolates included Escherichia coli (n = 113; 64.6%) and Klebsiella
      pneumoniae (n = 62; 35.4%). Of the 175 ESBL-E isolates, 48 (27.4%) were
      resistant to carbapenems (15 E. coli and 33 K. pneumoniae). CRE isolates
      carried bla(NDM) (n = 30; 62.5%), bla(NDM) + bla(OXA-181) (n = 10; 20.8%),
      bla(OXA-181) (n = 2; 4.2%) and bla(NDM) + bla(OXA-48) (n = 1; 2.1%); no
      carbapenemase gene was detected in 5 isolates (10.4%). The isolates showed
      low diversity and were mainly associated with multilocus sequence typing
      (MLST) sequence types ST410 for E. coli and ST395 and ST147 for K.
      pneumoniae. CONCLUSION: Carbapenem resistance is frequent among ESBL-E in
      Nigeria and is mainly associated with bla(NDM). Genotyping suggested that
      the observed clones possibly originated from Southeast Asia.

AB  - Carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae infections are an increasing
      global threat with scarce and uncertain treatment options. In this
      context, combination therapies are often used for these infections. The
      bactericidal and synergistic activity of fosfomycin plus amikacin and
      gentamicin was studied trough time-kill assays against four clonally
      unrelated clinical isolates of carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae,
      VIM-1, VIM-1 plus DHA-1, OXA-48 plus CTXM-15, and KPC-3, respectively. The
      efficacy of antimicrobials that showed synergistic activity in vitro
      against all the carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae were tested in
      monotherapy and in combination, in a murine peritoneal sepsis model. In
      vitro, fosfomycin plus amikacin showed synergistic and bactericidal effect
      against strains producing VIM-1, VIM-1 plus DHA-1, and OXA-48 plus
      CTX-M-15. Fosfomycin plus gentamicin had in vitro synergistic activity
      against the strain producing KPC-3. In vivo, fosfomycin and amikacin and
      its combination reduced the spleen bacterial concentration compared with
      controls groups in animals infected by K. pneumoniae producing VIM-1 and
      OXA-48 plus CTX-M-15. Moreover, amikacin alone and its combination with
      fosfomycin reduced the bacteremia rate against the VIM-1 producer strain.
      Contrary to the in vitro results, no in vivo efficacy was found with
      fosfomycin plus amikacin against the VIM-1 plus DHA-1 producer strain.
      Finally, fosfomycin plus gentamicin reduced the bacterial concentration in
      spleen against the KPC-3 producer strain. In conclusion, our results
      suggest that fosfomycin plus aminoglycosides has a dissimilar efficacy in
      the treatment of this severe experimental infection, when caused by
      different carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae strains. Fosfomycin plus
      amikacin or plus gentamycin may be useful to treat infections by OXA-48
      plus CTX-M-15 or KPC-3 producer strains, respectively.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Neonatal sepsis is a nuisance to clinicians and medical
      microbiologists, particularly those cases caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae.
      Thus, we aimed at investigating the profile and mechanisms of antibiotic
      resistance and the clonal relationships between K. pneumoniae isolated
      from neonates at the largest tertiary care hospital's neonatal intensive
      care units (NICUs) in Minia, Egypt. METHODS: This study comprised 156
      neonates diagnosed with culture-proven sepsis from February 2019 to
      September 2019, at a major NICU of Minia City. All K. pneumoniae isolates
      were collected and characterized by antimicrobial profile, resistance
      genotype, and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis typing. RESULTS:
      Twenty-four K. pneumoniae isolates (15.3%) were collected out of the 156
      sepsis diagnosed neonates. These samples showed extensive drug resistance
      (XDR) to most of the tested antimicrobials, except fluoroquinolones. All
      the K. pneumoniae isolates possessed bla (VIM) and bla (NDM) carbapenemase
      genes, while bla (KPC) gene was detected in 95.8%. Considering
      extended-spectrum β-lactamases genes, bla (CTX-M) was found in all the
      isolates and bla (OXA-1) gene in 75% of them. The plasmid-mediated
      quinolone resistance gene qnrS, was predominantly found among our isolates
      in comparison to qnrB or qnrA. A moderate degree of clonal relatedness was
      observed between the isolates. CONCLUSION: To the best of our knowledge,
      this the first report of an alarming occurrence of XDR among K. penumoniae
      isolates recovered from neonatal sepsis in Egypt. Our data necessitate
      proper antimicrobial stewardship as the choices will be very limited.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Israeli hospitals were confronted with a major national
      outbreak of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) starting in
      2006, caused predominantly by monoclonal Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. Our hospital, Rambam
      Health Care Campus (RHCC), was one of the medical centers affected by this
      outbreak. We aimed to investigate the changing epidemiology of CPE at RHCC
      since 2006. METHODS: This was a retrospective observational cohort study
      performed in Northern Israel (Haifa) at RHCC, which is a primary tertiary
      acute care academic hospital. The study included all patients who had
      acquired CPE at RHCC between January 2005 and December 2020. RESULTS: The
      proportion of patients infected with K. pneumoniae dropped from 100% of
      all CPE in the first years to 28% (37/134) in 2020. In 2014, the
      carbapenemase in 94% of all CPE patients (89/95) was KPC. This decreased
      to 56% in 2020, while New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM) and OXA-48
      carbapenemases increased from 4% and 2% to 29% (39/134) and 12.7% (17/134)
      of CPE, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The CPE epidemic evolved from
      KPC-producing K. pneumoniae to involve different Enterobacterales and
      carbapenemases. Our results are a microcosm of the current global
      epidemiology attesting to globalization in bacteriology. The results have
      implications for infection control and antibiotic treatment of CPE
      infections.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae
      (KPC-Kp) is an emerging global public health threat that causes
      life-threatening pneumonia and bacteremia. Ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA)
      represents a promising advance for the treatment of serious infections
      caused by KPC-Kp We investigated the pharmacokinetics and efficacy of
      ceftazidime-avibactam in the treatment of experimental KPC-Kp pneumonia in
      persistently neutropenic rabbits. For single-dose and multidose
      (administration every 8 h) pharmacokinetics, rabbits received
      ceftazidime-avibactam intravenous infusions at 60/15, 90/22.5, and 120/30
      mg/kg of body weight. Ceftazidime mean area under the concentration-time
      curves (AUCs) ranged from 287 to 608 μg·h/ml for a single dose and from
      300 to 781 μg·h/ml for multiple doses. Avibactam AUCs ranged from 21 to 48
      μg·h/ml for a single dose and from 26 to 48 μg·h/ml for multiple doses.
      KPC-Kp pneumonia was established by direct endotracheal inoculation.
      Treatments consisted of ceftazidime-avibactam at 120/30 mg/kg every 6 h, a
      polymyxin B (PMB) loading dose of 2.5 mg/kg followed by 1.5 mg/kg every 12
      h q12h, or no treatment (untreated controls [UC]). There were significant
      reductions in the residual bacterial burden, lung weights, and pulmonary
      hemorrhage scores in CZA- and PMB-treated rabbits for a 7-day or a 14-day
      (P ≤ 0.01) course in comparison with those in the UC. These results
      corresponded to significant decreases in the bacterial burden in
      bronchoalveolar lavage fluid after a 7-day or a 14-day treatment (P ≤
      0.01). The outcomes demonstrated an improved response at 14 days versus
      that at 7 days. There was significantly prolonged survival in rabbits
      treated with CZA for 14 days in comparison with that in the PMB-treated or
      UC rabbits (P ≤ 0.05). This study demonstrates that ceftazidime-avibactam
      displays linear dose-proportional exposures simulating those seen from
      human plasma pharmacokinetic profiles, is active for the treatment of
      experimental KPC-Kp pneumonia in persistently neutropenic rabbits, and
      provides an experimental foundation for the treatment of severely
      immunocompromised patients with this life-threatening infection.

AB  - Multi-drug resistant (MDR) Klebsiella pneumoniae represent a global threat
      to healthcare due to lack of effective treatments and high mortality
      rates. The aim of this research was to explore the potential of
      administering zidovudine (AZT) in combination with an existing antibiotic
      to treat resistant K. pneumoniae infections. Two MDR K. pneumoniae strains
      were employed, producing either the NDM-1 or KPC-3 carbapenemase. Efficacy
      of combinations of AZT with meropenem were compared with monotherapies
      against infections in Galleria mellonella larvae by measuring larval
      mortality and bacterial burden. The effect of the same combinations in
      vitro was determined via checkerboard and time-kill assays. In vitro, both
      K. pneumoniae strains were resistant to meropenem but were susceptible to
      AZT. In G. mellonella, treatment with either AZT or meropenem alone
      offered minimal therapeutic benefit against infections with either strain.
      In contrast, combination therapy of AZT with meropenem presented
      significantly enhanced efficacy compared to monotherapies. This was
      correlated with prevention of bacterial proliferation within the larvae
      but not elimination. Checkerboard assays showed that the interaction
      between AZT and meropenem was not synergistic but indifferent. In summary,
      combination therapy of AZT with meropenem represents a potential treatment
      for carbapenemase-producing MDR K. pneumoniae and merits further
      investigation.

AB  - Carbapenemase-producing combined porin loss is one of the primary
      mechanisms for carbapenem resistance. Although mutations in ompK35 and
      ompK36 genes have often been identified in carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella
      pneumoniae, reports on the porin protein gene disruption by insertion
      sequence (IS) elements are varied. The ompK36 porin protein gene
      disruption by IS elements and OmpK36 production loss in six
      bla(KPC-2)-carrying K. pneumoniae isolates were detected in this study.
      IS903, ISEc68, and IS1 insertions were noted in the 3, 2, and 1 isolates,
      respectively. The six K. pneumoniae isolates showed five different
      pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns and belonged to four multilocus
      sequence typing types, ST4, ST11, ST15, and ST39. This study increases our
      understanding of the genetic background of KPC-2 carbapenemases in
      porin-defective clinical isolates and the contribution of OmpK36
      production loss to carbapenem resistance.

AB  - From September to October 2019, seven patients colonised or infected with
      a ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA)-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenemase (KPC)-2-producing K. pneumoniae were detected in two
      intensive care units of a Greek general hospital. The outbreak strain was
      sequence type (ST)147 and co-produced KPC-2 and the novel plasmid-borne
      Vietnamese extended-spectrum β-lactamase (VEB)-25 harbouring a K234R
      substitution associated with CZA resistance. Epidemiological
      investigations revealed that the resistance was probably acquired by
      horizontal transmission independently from previous CZA exposure.

AB  - The convergence of carbapenem-resistance and hypervirulence genes in
      Klebsiella pneumoniae has led to the emergence of highly drug-resistant
      superbugs capable of causing invasive disease. We analyzed 556
      carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates from patients in Singapore
      hospitals during 2010-2015 and discovered 18 isolates from 7 patients also
      harbored hypervirulence features. All isolates contained a closely related
      plasmid (pKPC2) harboring bla(KPC-2), a K. pneumoniae carbapenemase gene,
      and had a hypervirulent background of capsular serotypes K1, K2, and K20.
      In total, 5 of 7 first patient isolates were hypermucoviscous, and 6 were
      virulent in mice. The pKPC2 was highly transmissible and remarkably
      stable, maintained in bacteria within a patient with few changes for
      months in the absence of antimicrobial drug selection pressure.
      Intrapatient isolates were also able to acquire additional antimicrobial
      drug resistance genes when inside human bodies. Our results highlight the
      potential spread of carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent K. pneumoniae in
      Singapore.

AB  - Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass
      spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has recently been used for the direct
      detection of KPC-producing isolates by analysis of the 11,109 Da mass peak
      representing the P019 protein. In this study, we evaluate the presence of
      the 11,109 Da mass peak in a collection of 435 unduplicated Klebsiella
      pneumoniae clinical isolates. The prevalence of the P019 peak in the
      bla(KPC) K. pneumoniae isolates was 49.2% (32/65). The 11,109 Da mass peak
      was not observed in any of the other carbapenemase (319) or
      noncarbapenemase producers (116). Computational analysis of the presence
      of the p019 gene was performed in the aforementioned
      carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae isolates fully characterized by
      whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and in a further collection of 1,649 K.
      pneumoniae genomes included in EuSCAPE. Herein, we have demonstrated that
      the p019 gene is not exclusively linked to the pKpQil plasmid but that it
      is present in the following plasmids: IncFIB(K)/IncFII(K)/ColRNAI,
      IncFIB(pQil), IncFIB(pQil)/ColRNAI, IncFIB(pQil)/IncFII(K),
      IncFIB(K)/IncFII(K), and IncX3. In addition, we have proven the
      independent movement of the Tn4401 and the ISKpn31, of which the p019 gene
      is a component. The absence of the p019 gene was obvious in Col440I,
      Col(pHAD28), IncFIB(K)/IncX3/IncFII(K), and IncFIB(K)/IncFII(K) plasmids.
      In addition, we also observed another plasmid in which neither Tn4401 nor
      ISKpn31 was found, IncP6. In the EuSCAPE, the occurrence of p019 varied
      from 0% to 100% among the different geographical locations. The adverse
      clinical impact of the diminished prevalence of the p019 gene within the
      plasmid encoding KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae puts forward the need
      for reconsideration when applying this technique in a clinical setting.

AB  - A rectal swab sample was collected from a patient with Guillain-Barré
      syndrome and enriched in lysogeny broth. Carbapenem-resistant bacteria
      were selected by China Blue agar plates containing 0.3 μg/ml meropenem.
      Carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella michiganensis was identified and
      characterized by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
      time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF), immune colloidal gold technique, a conjugation
      experiment, PCR analysis, and antimicrobial susceptibility testing. The
      genome of K. michiganensis was determined by whole genome sequencing.
      Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that the K. michiganensis was
      resistant to imipenem, meropenem, ertapenem, cefmetazole, ceftazidime,
      cefotaxime, piperacillin/tazobactam, sulbactam/cefoperazone,
      ceftazidime/avibactam, cefepime, and aztreonam while susceptible to
      polymyxin B, ciprofloxacin, tigecycline, and amikacin. Immune colloidal
      gold technique suggested that this strain co-produced three different
      carbapenemases [Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), New Delhi
      metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM), and Imipenem (IMP)]. Whole genome sequencing
      analysis indicated that this strain belonged to ST91, and bla (KPC-2), bla
      (NDM-1), and bla (IMP-4) were carried on different conjugative plasmids.
      Besides, the co-existence and transferability of bla (KPC-2), bla (NDM-1),
      and bla (IMP-4) in K. michiganensis facilitates the potential horizontal
      dissemination and nosocomial spread of resistance genes among
      multidrug-resistant organisms.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Infections caused by carbapenemase-producing
      Enterobacterales are frequent and associated with high rates of mortality.
      Intestinal carriers are at increased risk of infection by these
      microorganisms. Decolonisation strategies with antibiotics have not
      obtained conclusive results. Faecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) could
      be an effective and safe strategy to decolonise intestinal carriers of
      KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) but this hypothesis needs
      evaluation in appropriate clinical trials. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The
      KAPEDIS trial is a single-centre, randomised, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled, phase 2, superiority clinical trial of FMT for
      eradication of intestinal colonisation by KPC-Kp. One hundred and twenty
      patients with rectal colonisation by KPC-Kp will be randomised 1:1 to
      receive encapsulated lyophilised FMT or placebo. The primary outcome is
      KPC-Kp eradication at 30 days. Secondary outcomes are: (1) frequency of
      adverse events; (2) changes in KPC-Kp relative load within the intestinal
      microbiota at 7, 30 and 90 days, estimated by real-time quantitative PCR
      analysis of rectal swab samples and (3) rates of persistent eradication,
      KPC-Kp infection and crude mortality at 90 days. Participants will be
      monitored for adverse effects throughout the intervention. ETHICS AND
      DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval was obtained from Reina Sofía University
      Hospital Institutional Review Board (approval reference number:
      2019-003808-13). Trial results will be published in peer-reviewed journals
      and disseminated at national and international conferences. TRIAL

AB  - The emergence and rapid spread of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales
      represents a serious public health concern. Critically, these global
      priority bacteria have begun to be reported in companion animals, implying
      a potential risk of cross-transmission between humans and pets. Using
      long-read (MinION) and short-read (Illumina) sequencing technologies, we
      have identified and characterized a hypermucoviscous KPC-2-producing
      Klebsiella pneumoniae strain belonging to the high-risk international
      clone ST11/CG258, in a dog with urinary tract infection. Strikingly, the
      bla(KPC-2) gene was carried by a 54-kb IncN plasmid assignated to ST15,
      which shared 99.8 and 96.8% pairwise identity with IncN-pST15 plasmids
      from human and environmental K. pneumoniae strains, respectively; all come
      from an area with high endemicity of KPC-2. Our findings suggest that
      IncN-pST15 plasmids conferring carbapenem resistance can play as important
      a role as clonal transmission of K. pneumoniae, representing another major
      challenge for One Health.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae, one of the most common pathogens found in
      hospital-acquired infections, is often resistant to multiple antibiotics.
      In fact, multidrug-resistant (MDR) K. pneumoniae producing KPC or
      OXA-48-like carbapenemases are recognized as a serious global health
      threat. In this sense, we evaluated the virulence of K. pneumoniae KPC(+)
      or OXA-48(+) aiming at potential antimicrobial therapeutics. K. pneumoniae
      carbapenemase (KPC) and the expanded-spectrum oxacillinase OXA-48 isolates
      were obtained from patients treated in medical care units in Lisbon,
      Portugal. The virulence potential of the K. pneumonia clinical isolates
      was tested using the Galleria mellonella model. For that, G. mellonella
      larvae were inoculated using patients KPC(+) and OXA-48(+) isolates. Using
      this in vivo model, the KPC(+) K. pneumoniae isolates showed to be, on
      average, more virulent than OXA-48(+). Virulence was found attenuated when
      a low bacterial inoculum (one magnitude lower) was tested. In addition, we
      also report the use of a synthetic polycationic oligomer (L-OEI-h) as a
      potential antimicrobial agent to fight infectious diseases caused by MDR
      bacteria. L-OEI-h has a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity and exerts a
      significantly bactericidal activity within the first 5-30 min treatment,
      causing lysis of the cytoplasmic membrane. Importantly, the polycationic
      oligomer showed low toxicity against in vitro models and no visible
      cytotoxicity (measured by survival and health index) was noted on the in
      vivo model (G. mellonella), thus L-OEI-h is foreseen as a promising
      polymer therapeutic for the treatment of MDR K. pneumoniae infections.

AB  - The carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-hvKP)
      poses a severe therapeutic challenge to global public health, and research
      on CR-hvKP in older patients remain limited. In this study, we aimed to
      investigate the clinical and molecular characteristics and risk factors of
      CR-hvKP infections in older patients. We retrospectively investigated
      older patients with carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP)
      infections in the intensive care unit (ICU) between January 2020 and
      December 2020. The clinical data, and microbiological data including
      antimicrobial susceptibility testing, phenotype experiment and detection
      of carbapenemases, string test, virulence genes, capsular
      serotype-specific (cps) genes, and multilocus sequence typing, of the
      CR-hvKP group defined by the presence of any one of the virulence genes,
      including rmpA, rmpA2, iucA, iroN, and peg-344 were compared with those of
      CR-non-hvKP strains. Of the 80 CRKP strains, 51 (63.8%) met the definition
      of CR-hvKP. The main mechanism of resistance to carbapenems was the
      presence of the bla(KPC-2) gene. Sequence type (ST)11 (81.3%, 65/80) and
      ST15 (16.3%, 13/80) were the most common STs in CRKP strains. The minimum
      inhibitory concentration (MIC)(50) values of the CR-hvKP group against the
      six tested antibiotics (ceftazidime, ceftazidime-avibactam,
      imipenem-avibactam, tigecycline, levofloxacin, and Cefoperazone-Sulbactam)
      exhibited elevated levels than the CR-non-hvKP group. Ceftazidime and
      imipenem by combining avibactam (4 μg/mL) significantly decreased the
      MIC(90) values more than 16-fold than ceftazidime and imipenem alone
      against Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-2-producing K.
      pneumoniae. Cardiovascular disease [odds ratio (OR) = 11.956] and ST11-K64
      (OR = 8.385) appeared to be independent variables associated with CR-hvKP
      infection by multivariate analysis. In conclusion, higher MICs of the last
      line antibiotic agents (ceftazidime-avibactam, tigecycline) might be a
      critical consideration in the clinical management of older patients where
      the concentration of these toxic antibiotics matters because of underlying
      comorbidities. Caution regarding KPC-2-producing ST11-K64 CR-hvKP as being
      new significant "superbugs" is required as they are widespread, and
      infection control measures should be strengthened to curb further
      dissemination in nosocomial settings in China.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) carbapenemase
      (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae has rapidly expanded and is associated with
      severe nosocomial infections. Last-line antibiotics, such as colistin and
      tigecycline, remain the only treatment option. This study described the
      genetic background of a novel pan-resistant KPC-producing K. pneumoniae
      isolate from Tokyo, Japan. METHODS: The antibiotic susceptibility of
      clinical isolates from a patient hospitalised in 2016 was tested using a
      MicroScan WalkAway instrument and the broth microdilution method.
      Susceptibility was defined according to breakpoints provided by the
      Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute. Whole-genome sequencing was
      performed to detect acquired resistance genes and gene mutations. RESULTS:
      The isolates were identified as part of a laboratory stool and swab
      surveillance-screening program for infection control. The
      carbapenem-resistant strain was resistant to β-lactams, including
      broad-spectrum cephalosporins and carbapenems, and to aminoglycosides,
      chloramphenicol, fosfomycin, fluoroquinolones, polymyxins, tetracyclines,
      and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The K. pneumoniae isolate harboured a
      plasmid carrying fosA3, rmtB, bla(CTX-M-65), bla(SHV-12), and bla(KPC-2)
      in a non-Tn4401 mobile element. Colistin resistance was associated with a
      mutation in the mgrB gene, which regulates PhoP/PhoQ. The K. pneumoniae
      isolate belongs to sequence type 11, which is a successful epidemic-type
      strain. CONCLUSION: This study identified molecular resistance markers in
      a pan-resistant isolate and provided a genomic description of the
      pan-resistance and origins of the isolate and plasmid. The isolate is
      closely related to a recent highly pathogenic carbapenem-resistant K.
      pneumoniae identified in China; however, it lacks a virulence plasmid (but
      it could still act as a reservoir for a virulence plasmid). This K.
      pneumoniae isolate is of concern in hospital and community care settings.

AB  - Infections due to carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae have emerged
      as a global threat due to its widespread antimicrobial resistance.
      Transplant recipients and patients with hematologic malignancies have high
      mortality rate, suggesting host factors in susceptibility. We developed a
      model of pulmonary infection using ST258 strain C4, KPC-2 clone, which are
      predominant K. pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing (KPC-producing)
      bacteria, and demonstrated that Rag2-/- Il2rg-/- mice - but not WT C57BL/6
      or Rag2-/- mice - were susceptible to this opportunistic infection. Using
      single cell RNA sequencing in infected Rag2-/- mice, we identified
      distinct clusters of Ifng+ NK cells and Il17a+, Il22+, and inducible T
      cell costimulatory molecule-positive (ICOS+) group 3 innate lymphoid cells
      (ILCs) that were critical for host resistance. As solid organ
      transplantation is a risk factor, we generated a more clinically relevant
      model using FK506 in WT C57BL/6 mice. We further demonstrated that
      immunotherapy with recombinant IL-22 treatment ameliorated the ST258
      pulmonary infection in both FK506-treated WT mice and Rag2-/- Il2rg-/-
      mice via hepatic IL-22ra1 signaling. These data support the development of
      host-directed immunotherapy as an adjunct treatment to new antibiotics.

AB  - Although Ag-based materials are efficient against antibiotic-resistant
      bacteria, their high toxicity to living organisms represents a major
      challenge for obtaining useful products. In this work, we report the
      bactericidal activity of Ag(4)V(2)O(7)/β-AgVO(3) heterostructures, which
      proved to be effective against Klebsiella pneumoniae (ATCC 1706, a
      standard strain; A54970, a multidrug-resistant carbapenemase
      (KPC)-producing strain; A34057, a multidrug-resistant strain capable of
      producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL); and a
      community-isolated strain, A58240) at minimum inhibitory concentrations
      (MIC) as low as 62.5 μg/mL. This activity is higher than that reported for
      the individual silver vanadates (Ag(4)V(2)O(7) or β-AgVO(3)) owing to the
      synergistic interactions between both semiconductors. However, the most
      efficient heterostructure was found to be toxic to mouse 3 T3 fibroblasts
      and to L. sativa and C. sativus seeds, as indicated by MTT ((4,5 -
      dimethylthiazol -2yl) 2,5 -diphenylbromide), neutral red assays and
      germination index measurements. The antimicrobial, phytotoxic and
      cytotoxic activities were all associated with an efficient generation of
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the heterostructure, especially OH and
      O(2)(-) radicals. The ROS production by Ag(4)V(2)O(7)/β-AgVO(3)
      heterostructures was measured through photodegradation studies with
      Rhodamine B. While the bactericidal activity of the heterostructures is
      promising, especially when compared to Ag-based materials, their use in
      practical applications will require encapsulation either to avoid leaching
      or to mitigate their toxicity to humans, animals and plants.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance remains one of the most challenging issues that
      threatens the health of people around the world. Plant-derived natural
      compounds have received considerable attention for their potential role to
      mitigate antibiotic resistance. This study was carried out to assess the
      antimicrobial activity and mode of action of a monoterpene, 1,8-cineol
      (CN) against carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-KP).
      Results showed that resazurin microplate assay and time-kill analysis
      revealed bactericidal effects of CN at 28.83 mg/mL. Zeta potential showed
      that CN increased the surface charge of bacteria and an increase of outer
      membrane permeability was also detected. CN was able to cause leakage of
      proteins and nucleic acids in KPC-KP cells upon exposure to CN and
      ethidium bromide influx/efflux experiment showed the uptake of ethidium
      bromide into the cell; this was attributed to membrane damage. CN was also
      found to induce oxidative stress in CN-treated KPC-KP cells through
      generation of reactive oxygen species which initiated lipid peroxidation
      and thus damaging the bacterial cell membrane. Scanning and transmission
      electron microscopies further confirmed the disruption of bacterial cell
      membrane and loss of intracellular materials. In this study, we
      demonstrated that CN induced oxidative stress and membrane damage
      resulting in KPC-KP cell death.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae carrying bla(NDM-1)
      and bla(KPC-2) genes are a worldwide concern for which combination
      antimicrobial therapy may be the only viable option. The aim of this study
      was to investigate the in vitro activity of combinations of polymyxin B
      (PMB) with meropenem (MEM), amikacin (AMK) and gentamicin (GEN) at
      subinhibitory concentrations against two K. pneumoniae clinical isolates
      co-harbouring bla(NDM-1), bla(KPC-2) and aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes
      and resistant to PMB. METHODS: Synergy and bactericidal activity were
      evaluated by chequerboard and time-kill assays against two PMB-resistantK.
      pneumoniae clinical isolates carrying the bla(NDM-1), bla(KPC-2),
      aac(3)-IIa, aac(6')-Ib, aph(3')-VI and ant(2'')-Ia genes. Five
      combinations of PMB, MEM, AMK and GEN were evaluated. RESULTS: The PMB/MEM
      and PMB/AMK combinations proved to be the best options against isolate
      K7R2, mainly because they demonstrated bactericidal activity when using
      subinhibitory concentrations of these antimicrobials. However, none of the
      studied combinations was bactericidal against isolate K11R2. CONCLUSION:
      The combinations used in this study showed synergy against NDM-and
      KPC-producing isolates but, given their bactericidal activity, the
      combinations of PMB/MEM and PMB/AMK were the most active against one
      isolate. It can also be concluded that the antimicrobials to which the
      bacteria were resistant could form part of combination therapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing burden of carbapenem resistance among
      Enterobacterales is attributable to their ability to produce carbapenemase
      enzymes like metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL), Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenemase (KPC), and OXA-type. This study aimed to determine the
      prevalence of carbapenemases and MBL genes ((bla (NDM-1,) bla (NDM-1) and
      bla (NDM-3)) among E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates. METHODS: A total of
      2474 urine samples collected during the study period (July-December 2017)
      were processed at the microbiology laboratory of Kathmandu Model Hospital,
      Kathmandu. Isolates of E. coli and K. pneumoniae were processed for
      antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) by disc diffusion method.
      Carbapenem-resistant isolates were subjected to Modified Hodge Test (MHT)
      for phenotypic confirmation, and inhibitor-based combined disc tests for
      the differentiation of carbapenemase (MBL and KPC). MBL-producing isolates
      were screened for NDM genes by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS:
      Of the total urine samples processed, 19.5% (483/2474) showed the
      bacterial growth. E. coli (72.6%; 351/483) was the predominant isolate
      followed by K. pneumoniae (12.6%; 61/483). In AST, 4.4% (18/412) isolates
      of E. coli (15/351) and K. pneumonia (3/61) showed resistance towards
      carbapenems, while 1.7% (7/412) of the isolates was confirmed as
      carbapenem-resistant in MHT. In this study, all (3/3) the isolates of K.
      pneumoniae were KPC-producers, whereas 66.7% (10/15), 20% (3/15) and 13.3%
      (2/15) of the E. coli isolates were MBL, KPC and MBL/KPC (both)-producers,
      respectively. In PCR assay, 80% (8/10), 90% (9/10) and 100% (10/10) of the
      isolates were positive for bla (NDM-1), bla (NDM-2) and bla (NDM-3,)
      respectively. CONCLUSION: Presence of NDM genes among
      carbapenemase-producing isolates is indicative of potential spread of
      drug-resistant variants. This study recommends the implementation of
      molecular diagnostic facilities in clinical settings for proper infection
      control, which can optimize the treatment therapies, and curb the
      emergence and spread of drug-resistant pathogens.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Antibiotic resistance in carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella
      pneumoniae is acquired and disseminated mainly by plasmids. Therefore, we
      aimed to investigate the occurrence of carbapenemase genes, analyze the
      genetic diversity by ERIC-PCR, and examine the most common plasmid
      incompatibility groups (Incs) in clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae from
      colonization and infection in patients from a hospital in Brazil. METHODS:
      Twenty-seven isolates of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae were selected
      and screened for the presence of carbapenemase genes and Incs by PCR,
      followed by amplicon sequencing. RESULTS: The bla KPC and bla NDM genes
      were detected in 24 (88.8 %) and 16 (59.2 %) of the isolates,
      respectively. Thirteen isolates (48.1 %) were positive for both genes. The
      IncFIB (92.6 %) and IncQ (88.8 %) were the most frequent plasmids,
      followed by IncA/C, IncHI1B, and IncL/M, indicating that plasmid
      variability existed in these isolates. To our knowledge, this is the first
      report of IncHI1B in Brazil. We found eight isolates with clonal
      relationship distributed in different sectors of the hospital.
      CONCLUSIONS: The accumulation of resistance determinants, the variability
      of plasmid Incs, and the clonal dissemination detected in K. pneumoniae
      isolates demonstrate their potential for infection, colonization, and the
      dissemination of different resistance genes and plasmids.

AB  - This study focused on the characterization of 19 hypermucoviscous
      Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, that were identified from 26 hypermucosal
      strains. In order to identify hypermucoviscous strains of K. pneumoniae,
      the string test was applied. This phenotype is known in the literature as
      one of the virulence factors of this species together with the production
      of biofilm and other hypervirulence factor genes such as: rmpA, rmpA2,
      iucA, iroB, peg-344. We also investigated presence of magA gene that
      correlates with the hyper-production of capsule of K1 serotype. Of the
      strains under study, 13 out of 19 harboured at least one virulence
      factor.Sequence type (ST) was determined in order to identify known
      high-risk clones or new emerging high-risk clones and their variability in
      a single clinical setting. Important STs found among these strains were
      ST65 and ST29. Carbapenem resistance was also investigated and 4 out of 19
      strains harboured at least a carbapenemase: one strain harboured a KPC
      enzyme alone, one strain carried a KPC and an OXA-48 like, one strain
      produced OXA-48-like alone, and the last strain harboured two
      metallo-β-lactamases (VIM-1 and NDM-5) plus OXA-48-like. In particular,
      this latter strain belongs to ST383, which was recently reported in
      Northern Italy as a hypervirulent and XDR strain.The global spread of
      hypervirulent K. pneumoniae is an important epidemiological issue that
      should be considered in diagnostic and therapeutic managements of patients
      with K. pneumoniae infections.

AB  - Genomic surveillance can inform effective public health responses to
      pathogen outbreaks. However, integration of non-local data is rarely done.
      We investigate two large hospital outbreaks of a carbapenemase-carrying
      Klebsiella pneumoniae strain in Germany and show the value of contextual
      data. By screening about 10 000 genomes, over 400 000 metagenomes and two
      culture collections using in silico and in vitro methods, we identify a
      total of 415 closely related genomes reported in 28 studies. We identify
      the relationship between the two outbreaks through time-dated phylogeny,
      including their respective origin. One of the outbreaks presents extensive
      hidden transmission, with descendant isolates only identified in other
      studies. We then leverage the genome collection from this meta-analysis to
      identify genes under positive selection. We thereby identify an inner
      membrane transporter (ynjC) with a putative role in colistin resistance.
      Contextual data from other sources can thus enhance local genomic
      surveillance at multiple levels and should be integrated by default when
      available.

AB  - Imipenem-relebactam is a novel β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor combination.
      We evaluated the in vitro activity of imipenem-relebactam and comparators
      against Enterobacterales clinical isolates recovered in 8 Spanish and 11
      Portuguese intensive care units (ICUs) (SUPERIOR, 2016-2017; STEP,
      2017-2018). Overall, 747 Enterobacterales isolates (378 Escherichia coli,
      252 Klebsiella spp., 64 Enterobacter spp., and 53 other species) were
      prospectively collected from ICU patients with complicated intraabdominal
      (cIAI), complicated urinary tract (cUTI), and lower respiratory tract
      (LRTI) infections. MICs were determined (ISO-broth microdilution), and
      whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed in a subset of isolates
      displaying susceptible and resistant imipenem-relebactam MICs.
      Imipenem-relebactam (98.7% susceptible) showed similar activity to
      ceftazidime-avibactam (99.5% susceptible) and higher than
      ceftolozane-tazobactam (86.9% susceptible). Imipenem-relebactam was
      inactive against 1.3% (10/747) isolates, all of them due to carbapenemase
      production (9 K. pneumoniae and 1 E. cloacae). Imipenem-relebactam was
      active against 100% of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-E. coli and
      ESBL-Klebsiella spp. isolates and 80.4% of carbapenemase-Klebsiella spp.
      producers. Carbapenemase genes were confirmed by WGS in 41 Klebsiella
      spp.: OXA-48 (20/41), KPC-3 (14/41), OXA-181 (4/41), NDM-1 (1/41), OXA-48
      + VIM-2 (1/41), and KPC-3 + VIM-2 (1/41). In Klebsiella spp. isolates,
      relebactam restored imipenem susceptibility in all KPC-3 producers, and
      resistant isolates (7/41) were mostly OXA-48 + CTX-M-15-K. pneumoniae
      high-risk clones (7/9). Intercountry differences were detected as follows:
      OXA-48 (17/21) was dominant in Spain, unlike KPC-3 (14/15) in Portugal.
      Imipenem-relebactam was 100% active against CTX-M-15-ST131-H30Rx-E. coli
      high-risk clone, predominant in both countries. Our results depict the
      potential role of imipenem-relebactam in ICU patients with cIAIs, cUTIs,
      and LRTIs due to wild-type ESBL- and carbapenemase-producing
      Enterobacterales, particularly KPC producers. IMPORTANCE We comparatively
      evaluate the in vitro activity of a drug combination consisting of a
      carbapenem (imipenem) and a novel inhibitor of beta-lactamases
      (relebactam), a mechanism that destroys beta-lactam antibiotics. We assess
      the activity against a collection of Enterobacterales clinical isolates
      recovered from difficult-to-treat infections in patients admitted to
      different intensive care units in Portugal and Spain. Imipenem-relebactam
      shows excellent activity in avoiding common resistance mechanisms in this
      setting, such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and carbapenemases
      widely distributed, including KPCs. We show few resistant isolates (<2%).
      Molecular characterization by whole-genome sequencing shows that most of
      the resistant isolates produced specific carbapenemase, such as OXA-48 or
      metalo-betalactamases. Our study updates the activity of
      imipenem-relebactam in light of current epidemiology in a hospital setting
      in which the use of this combination is needed due to the presence of
      infections due to multidrug-resistant isolates.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The drug resistance phenotype and molecular epidemiological
      characteristics of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) were
      identified among children in Jiangsu Province, China. METHODS: CRKP
      strains were collected from the Children's Hospital of Nanjing Medical
      University from December 2020 to March 2022. CRKP strains were
      characterized for further study: antimicrobial susceptibility testing,
      carbapenem resistance genes and homology analysis. RESULTS: Among 86
      strains of CRKP, 85 carried carbapenemase genes; the dominant gene was bla
      (KPC-2) (88.2%, 75/85), followed by bla (NDM-1) (4.7%, 4/85), bla (NDM-5)
      (4.7%, 4/85), bla (IMP-8) (2.3%, 2/85), and bla (OXA-181) (1.2%, 1/85).
      Among the 86 strains of CRKP, one isolate contained both the bla (NDM-5)
      and bla (OXA-181) genes, which is the first time that Klebsiella
      pneumoniae has been shown to jointly carry these genes in China. Another
      CRKP strain did not carry any carbapenemase gene. MLST analysis identified
      a total of 10 different sequence types, among which sequence type (ST) 11
      was the most common. PFGE analysis identified 75 bla (KPC-2)-producing
      CRKP ST11 strains, of which 68 were dominant clusters distributed among 11
      different wards, mainly the neonatal medical centre (18 strains), neonatal
      surgery (17 strains) and cardiac care unit (CCU) (8 strains) wards.
      CONCLUSION: Clonal dissemination of KPC-2-producing CRKP ST11 was observed
      in multiple departments. Additionally, non-ST11 strains showed high
      polymorphism based on molecular typing, indicating increasing diversity in
      CRKP strains. To our knowledge, this is the first report of NDM-5 and
      OXA-181-coproducing Klebsiella pneumoniae causing infection in children in
      China, which poses a significant health risk for paediatric patients.
      Active surveillance and effective control measures are urgently needed to
      prevent further transmission of these strains among children.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to report on in vitro tests of
      antibacterial activity of ceftazidime/avibactam in combination against
      planktonic or biofilm KPC carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae
      (KPC-Kp), the rate of KPC-Kp blood isolates in University of Perugia
      Hospital over a 5-year period, and their antimicrobial susceptibility
      patterns. METHODS: The antibacterial activity of ceftazidime/avibactam in
      combination with other antimicrobials was assessed against planktonic and
      biofilm bacteria by Etest and checkerboard assay. A retrospective review
      of laboratory data was performed to evaluate the rate of KPC-Kp from blood
      samples and their antimicrobial susceptibility patterns. RESULTS: Between
      2014 and 2019, 130/4241 (3.1%) KPC-Kp were identified from blood cultures.
      Their rate increased from 2.3% in 2014-2015 to 4.5% over the last 3 years.
      Overall, 4.6% (6/130) of KPC-Kp isolates were susceptible to meropenem,
      65.4% (85/130) to colistin, 65.1% (84/129) to tigecycline, 34.6% (45/130)
      to amikacin, 36.2% (42/116) to gentamicin, 40.2% (39/97) to fosfomycin and
      91.5% (65/71) to ceftazidime/avibactam. Five of six
      ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant KPC-Kp were isolated from patients not
      treated with ceftazidime/avibactam. Synergism was detected both by Etest
      and checkerboard assay for the combination of ceftazidime/avibactam plus
      meropenem against planktonic isolates, whilst lower bactericidal activity
      was observed in biofilm KPC-Kp isolates. CONCLUSIONS: Our in vitro data
      suggest that the combination of ceftazidime/avibactam plus meropenem has a
      synergistic antibacterial activity against planktonic bacteria, whilst a
      lower activity was detected against biofilm, suggesting worse clinical
      outcomes whenever biofilm infections are present. Further analyses are
      required to confirm these results before extending them to clinical
      practice.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae infection lacks
      treatment options and is associated with prolonged hospital stays and high
      mortality rates. The production of carbapenemases is one of the most
      important factors responsible for this multi-resistance phenomenon.
      METHODS: In the present study, we analyzed the presence of genes encoding
      carbapenemases in K. pneumoniae isolates circulating in one of the public
      hospitals in the city of Aracaju, Sergipe, Brazil. We also determined the
      best combination of drugs that display in vitro antimicrobial synergy.
      First, 147 carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates were validated for
      the presence of blaKPC, bla GES, bla NDM, bla SPM, bla IMP, bla VIM, and
      bla OXA-48 genes using multiplex polymerase chain reaction. Thereafter,
      using two isolates (97 and 102), the role of double and triple
      combinational drug therapy as a treatment option was analyzed. RESULTS:
      Seventy-four (50.3%) isolates were positive for bla NDM, eight (5.4%) for
      bla KPC, and one (1.2%) for both bla NDM and bla KPC. In the synergy
      tests, double combinations were better than triple combinations. Polymyxin
      B and amikacin for isolate 97 and polymyxin B coupled with meropenem for
      isolate 102 showed the best response. CONCLUSIONS: Clinicians in normal
      practice use multiple drugs to treat infections caused by multi-resistant
      microorganism; however, in most cases, the benefit of the combinations is
      unknown. In vitro synergistic tests, such as those described herein, are
      important as they might help select an appropriate multi-drug antibiotic
      therapy and a correct dosage, ultimately reducing toxicities and the
      development of antibiotic resistance.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) poses
      a major threat to human health worldwide. Combination therapies of
      antibiotics with different mechanisms have been recommended in
      literatures. This study assessed in vitro antibacterial activities and
      synergistic activities of ceftazidime/avibactam alone and in combinations
      against KPC-Kp. In total, 70 isolates from 2 hospitals in Beijing were
      examined in our study. By using the agar dilution method and broth
      dilution method, we determined the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC)
      of candidate antibiotics. Ceftazidime/avibactam demonstrated promising
      susceptibility against KPC-Kp (97.14%). Synergistic activities testing was
      achieved by checkerboard method and found ceftazidime/avibactam-amikacin
      displayed synergism in 90% isolates. Ceftazidime/avibactam-colistin
      displayed partial synergistic in 43% isolates, and
      ceftazidime/avibactam-tigecycline displayed indifference in 67% isolates.
      In time-kill assays, antibiotics at 1-fold MIC were mixed with bacteria at
      1 × 105 CFU/ml and Mueller-Hinton broth (MHB). Combinations of
      ceftazidime/avibactam with amikacin and tigecycline displayed better
      antibacterial effects than single drug. Ceftazidime/avibactam-colistin
      combination did not exhibit better effect than single drug. In KPC-Kp
      infections, susceptibility testing suggested that ceftazidime/avibactam
      may be considered as first-line choice. However, monotherapy is often
      inadequate in infection management. Thus, our study revealed that
      combination therapy including ceftazidime/avibactam colistin and
      ceftazidime/avibactam tigecycline may benefit than monotherapy in KPC-Kp
      treatment. Further pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic and mutant prevention
      concentration studies should be performed to optimize multidrug-regimens.

AB  - Carbapenemase production in Enterobacterales clinical isolates is a global
      threat. Multi-drug resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae harboring
      carbapenemases are a major concern among the hospital settings in Latin
      America. Aim: The aim of this study was to analyze the genetic relatedness
      between three isolates of K. pneumoniae recovered from one patient in the
      same bacteriological round on the same day, which exhibited different
      susceptibility profiles to carbapenems (CP) and to colistin (Col).
      Isolates' profiles were as follows (susceptible-S/resistant-R):
      CP(S)/Col(R), CP(R)/Col(R), and CP(R)/Col(S). Pulse-field gel
      electrophoresis, multilocus sequence typing, and whole genome sequencing
      were performed. Conjugation assays were carried out and PCR determination
      in transconjugants (Tcs) was made for: bla(CTX-M-groups), bla(NDM),
      bla(KPC), bla(TEM), qnr alleles, aac(6')Ib-cr, ermB, and plasmid
      incompatibility groups (Inc). Results: All isolates belonged to the same
      clone, to ST258 and harbored bla(CTX-M-14), bla(CTX-M-15), qnrA1, qnrB1,
      aac(6')Ib-cr, and wzi154 (capsule-locus KL107). One isolate had additional
      wzi gene, wzi109 (capsule-locus KL36). In CP(R) isolates, the pattern was
      explained for bla(NDM-1) or bla(NDM-1)/bla(KPC-2) presence, and in Col(R)
      for IS5-like element insertion in mgrB at different positions.
      Co-mobilization of bla(NDM-1)/qnrA1 was associated to a different plasmid
      Inc (A/C-FII) in both bla(NDM-1) donors. Mobilization of bla(CTX-M-14) was
      related to IncI1 in one donor. Conclusion: These findings highlight the
      potential plasticity of ST258 K. pneumoniae clone. To the best of our
      knowledge, this is the first description of
      bla(NDM-1)/bla(KPC-2)-producing K. pneumoniae ST258 in Latin America.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) bacteria are an increasing threat to public
      health and represent one of the most concerning pathogens involved in
      life-threatening infections and antimicrobial resistance (AMR). To
      understand the epidemiology of AMR of Kp in Portugal, we analysed whole
      genome sequencing, susceptibility testing and other meta data on 509
      isolates collected nationwide from 16 hospitals and environmental settings
      between years 1980 and 2019. Predominant sequence types (STs) included
      ST15 (n = 161, 32%), ST147 (n = 36, 7%), ST14 (n = 26, 5%) or ST13 (n =
      26, 5%), while 31% of isolates belonged to STs with fewer than 10
      isolates. AMR testing revealed widespread resistance to aminoglycosides,
      fluoroquinolones, cephalosporins and carbapenems. The most common
      carbapenemase gene was bla(KPC-3). Whilst the distribution of AMR linked
      plasmids appears uncorrelated with ST, their frequency has changed over
      time. Before year 2010, the dominant plasmid group was associated with the
      extended spectrum beta-lactamase gene bla(CTX-M-15), but this group
      appears to have been displaced by another carrying the bla(KPC-3) gene.
      Co-carriage of bla(CTX-M) and bla(KPC-3) was uncommon. Our results from
      the largest genomics study of Kp in Portugal highlight the active
      transmission of strains with AMR genes and provide a baseline set of
      variants for future resistance monitoring and epidemiological studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Klebsiella pneumoniae is commonly isolated after lung
      transplantation. This study observed an increase in bronchial
      complications after an outbreak of Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella (KPC-KP). METHODS: The study enrolled
      173 patients who had undergone bilateral lung transplantation between 2012
      and 2018 to examine the association between bronchial complications after
      lung transplantation and KPC-KP. The KPC-KP group was defined as patients
      whose isolates from sputum or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were positive
      for KPC-KP. The presence of bronchial complications was defined as a
      positive finding on bronchoscopy in accordance with the criteria of the
      International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation. Risk factors for
      bronchial complications were analyzed. RESULTS: KPC-KP was identified in
      29 patients (16.8%), and bronchial dehiscence was observed in 13 patients
      (7.5%). Smoking (odds ratio [OR], 5.690; 95% confidence interval [CI],
      1.106- to 9.260; P = .037), the presence of KPC-KP (OR, 5.360; 95% CI,
      1.380 to 20.810; P = .015), and bronchial necrosis (OR, 7.009; 95% CI,
      1.811 to 27.124; P = .005) were associated with bronchial dehiscence in a
      multivariate logistic regression model. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of
      KPC-KP in lung-transplant recipients significantly increased the risk of
      bronchial dehiscence, independent of bronchial necrosis. Thus, patients
      with KPC-KP require greater surveillance and follow-up bronchoscopy,
      irrespective of the presence or absence of bronchial necrosis or the
      overall patient condition.

AB  - KPC-12 is a variant of KPC-2 with a L169M substitution in the Ω loop, but
      its resistance spectrum was not reported. bla(KPC-12) was cloned, and
      KPC-12 exhibited significantly decreased activities against imipenem,
      meropenem, aztreonam, and piperacillin-tazobactam with ≥4-fold lower MICs
      than KPC-2. However, unlike the L169P substitution in KPC-35, activities
      against ceftazidime and ceftazidime-avibactam of KPC-12 were unaltered.
      This highlights that different substitutions at the same position of
      carbapenemases may have varied impact on the activity.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae is a Gram-negative bacterium of clinical importance,
      due to its resistance to several antibiotic classes. We have identified 4
      clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae sequence type (ST) 392 KPC-3-producing
      strains from patients at the Istituto Mediterraneo per i Trapianti e
      Terapie ad Alta Specializzazione (IRCCS-ISMETT), a Southern Italian
      transplantation health facility, during a routine surveillance for
      carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales from in-house clinical samples.
      Since those were among, to the best of our knowledge, the first
      KPC-producing K. pneumoniae ST392 isolated in Europe, we assessed their
      virulence potential, to understand if this particular ST can become an
      endemic clinical threat. ST392 isolates were investigated to assess their
      virulence potential, namely resistance to human sera, formation of abiotic
      biofilms, adhesion to biotic surfaces, exopolysaccharide production and in
      vivo pathogenesis in the wax moth Galleria mellonella animal model.
      ST392-belonging strains were highly resistant to human sera. These strains
      also have a high capacity to form abiotic biofilms and high levels of
      adhesion to the human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma HT-29 cell
      line. An increase of transcriptional levels of genes involved in serum
      resistance (aroE and traT) and adhesion (pgaA) was observed when compared
      with the Klebsiella quasipneumoniae subsp. similipneumoniae strain ATCC
      700603 reference strain. Infection of G. mellonella larvae with ST392
      clinical isolates showed that the latter were not highly pathogenic in
      this model. Together, our results indicate that ST392 isolates have the
      potential to become a strain of clinical relevance, especially in health
      settings where patients are immunosuppressed, e.g., transplant recipients.

AB  - Dissemination of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae poses a threat
      to the successful treatment of bacterial diseases and increases the need
      for new antibacterial agents development. The objective of this study was
      to determine the antimicrobial activity of carvacrol against
      multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae. Carbapenemase production was detected
      by MALDI-TOF. The PCR and sequencing showed that the blaKPC-2, blaOXA-48,
      blaNDM-1, blaCTX-M-8 genes were present in carbapenem-resistant K.
      pneumoniae strains. The polymyxin-resistant K. pneumoniae strain exhibited
      alterations in mgrB gene. The antimicrobial activity of carvacrol was
      evaluated in vitro using broth microdilution and time-kill methods. For
      this, carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae and polymyxin-resistant strains,
      were evaluated. The in vitro results showed that carvacrol had
      antimicrobial activity against all isolates evaluated. The survival curves
      showed that carvacrol eradicated all of the bacterial cells within 4 h.
      The antimicrobial effect of carvacrol in vivo was determined using a mouse
      model of infection with Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC). The
      treatment with carvacrol was associated with increased survival, and
      significantly reduced bacterial load in peritoneal lavage. In addition,
      groups treated with carvacrol, had a significant reduction in the total
      numbers of white cell and significantly increased of platelets when
      compared to the untreated group. In vivo and in vitro studies showed that
      carvacrol regimens exhibited significant antimicrobial activity against
      KPC-producing K. pneumoniae, making it an interesting candidate for
      development of alternative treatments.

AB  - BACKGROUND: KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae of clonal group 258 are
      prominent in healthcare settings in many regions of the world. The blaKPC
      gene is mostly carried by a multireplicon IncFIIk-IncFI plasmid suspected
      to be highly compatible and stable in this genetic background. Here, we
      analysed the genetic diversity of an ST512 K. pneumoniae population in a
      single patient. METHODS: Twelve K. pneumoniae isolates (n = 5 from urine
      samples and n = 7 from rectal swabs) were recovered from one patient over
      a 2 month period. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, plasmid extraction
      and WGS were performed on all isolates. The first K. pneumoniae isolate,
      D1, was used as a reference for phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS:
      Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, plasmid analysis and WGS revealed
      concomitant carriage of carbapenem-resistant and carbapenem-susceptible K.
      pneumoniae isolates of ST512, with the absence of the entire
      blaKPC-carrying plasmid in the susceptible population. Furthermore, 14
      other genetic events occurred within the genome, including 3 chromosomal
      deletions (of 71 kb, 33 kb and 11 bp), 2 different insertions of ISKpn26
      and 9 SNPs. Interestingly, most of the events occurred in the same
      chromosomal region that has been deleted independently several times,
      probably after homologous recombination involving 259 bp repeated
      sequences. CONCLUSIONS: Our study revealed (to the best of our knowledge)
      the first case of in vivo blaKPC-carrying plasmid curing and a wide
      within-patient genetic diversity of a single K. pneumoniae ST512 clone
      over a short period of carriage. This within-patient diversity must be
      taken into account when characterizing transmission chains using WGS
      during nosocomial outbreaks.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance due to carbapenemase production in
      Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates is a global threat.
      Klebsiellapneumoniae harboring the bla(KPC) gene is one of the major
      concerns in hospital settings in Latin America. The aim of this study was
      to characterize the antibiotic resistance mechanisms and to typify four
      carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae clinical isolates from the city of
      Manizales, Colombia. We identified bla(KPC-3) in all four isolates by
      polymerase chain reaction and subsequent sequencing. The plasmid-mediated
      quinolone resistance genes qnrB19-like and aac(6')Ib-cr; fosfomycin
      resistance gene fosA and an insertion sequence IS5-like in mgrB (colistin
      resistance) were also detected. Sequence types ST11 with capsular type
      wzi75, and ST258 with wzi154, were characterized. The bla(KPC-3) gene was
      mobilized in a 100-kb IncFIB conjugative plasmid with vagCD
      toxin-antitoxin system. This work reports multiple resistance genes in
      bla(KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae and the first occurrence of ST11 clinical
      isolates harboring bla(KPC-3) in Latin America.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing Enterobacteriaceae
      (ESBL-PE) and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) are
      disseminated worldwide posing a serious public health concern. Although,
      the presence of ESBL-PE and CRE in Sri Lanka has been reported, the
      prevalence is unknown. This study aimed to provide up-to-date
      epidemiological data on multidrug-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and to
      characterize the molecular determinants of carbapenemase-producing
      Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) in Sri Lanka. METHODS: A prospective
      cross-sectional study was conducted at a tertiary care hospital in Sri
      Lanka between December 2017 and February 2018. ESBL-PE and CRE were
      identified by disc diffusion method. Carbapenemase production was
      determined by carbapenem inactivation method and the presence of selected
      carbapenemase genes were detected by PCR. RESULTS: Five hundred and ninety
      three Enterobacteriaceae were isolated from variety of clinical samples.
      Overall prevalence of ESBL-PE and CRE were 26.0% (n = 154) and 9.6% (n =
      57), respectively. The highest rate of ESBL-PE (30.8%) was found in urine
      samples, while the highest occurrence of CRE (20.8%) was seen in
      respiratory specimens. The most common CRE species identified was K.
      pneumoniae (n = 46, 80.7%), followed by C. freundii (n = 4, 7.0%), E. coli
      (n = 3, 5.3%), P. rettgeri (n = 2, 3.5%), E. cloacae (n = 1, 1.7%), and K.
      aerogenes (n = 1, 1.7%). Carbapenemase production was observed in 54
      (94.7%) of CRE isolates. Fifty eight carbapenemase encoding genes were
      identified in 54 CPE. The most prevalent carbapenemase gene was
      bla(OXA-48-like) (n = 48, 88.9%), followed by bla(NDM) (n = 8, 14.8%), and
      bla(KPC) (n = 2, 3.7%). CONCLUSION: This study reports an alarming rate of
      CRE and the emergence of bla(KPC) harboring K. pneumoniae in Sri Lanka.
      The need for preventive measures is highlighted to limit the spread of
      these difficult-to-treat bacteria in the country.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) is
      considered as a serious global threat. CRKPs occurred only sporadically in
      the Second Hospital of Shanxi Medical University. Our study aimed to
      investigate and control the first outbreak of CRKP in our hospital
      occurred between October 2017 and August 2019. METHODS: The antimicrobial
      stewardship (AMS) workers have been implemented control measures properly.
      Clinical and epidemiological data were retrospectively collected from
      medical records. Carbapenemase genes were detected by modified carbapenem
      inactivation method (mCIM) test and the EDTA-modified carbapenem
      inactivation method (eCIM) test. Resistance genes were identified by
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing. Genetic relatedness was
      studied by multilocus sequence typing (MLST). RESULTS: During the
      outbreak, 31 patients were infected with CRKP isolates. 20 (64.5%)
      patients were infected with KPC-2 and/or NDM-1 producing K. pneumoniae.
      Mostly MLST-sequence types belonged to ST11 (21/31). The outbreak was two
      major K. pneumoniae clusters present in epidemiologically linked patients.
      CONCLUSIONS: Setting up AMS workers is potentially a highly efficient
      strategy for the successful control of the outbreak. A multimodal and
      multidisciplinary infection control strategy proved to be crucial. The
      emergence of CRKP in our hospital emphasizes the importance of continuous
      monitoring of these isolates, which helps to limit the spread of CRKPs and
      improve the level of management.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the undetected circulation of an epidemic
      BKC-1-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae ST442 clone, occasioning the first
      reported outbreak of the infrequent carbapenemase BKC-1. METHODS: Six
      hundred and forty-seven K. pneumoniae isolates (2008-2017) with reduced
      susceptibility to carbapenems were screened for bla(BKC-1). BKC-1-positive
      isolates were typed using pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multi-locus
      sequence typing. Susceptibility profiles were determined by broth
      microdilution, and additional antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) were
      investigated by polymerase chain reaction. Some isolates were submitted to
      full genomic characterization by whole-genome sequencing (Illumina MiSeq
      and MinIon), and in-vivo virulence studies using the Galleria mellonella
      model. RESULTS: Sixteen (2.5%) K. pneumoniae, from 15 patients, carrying
      bla(BKC-1) were found between 2010 and 2012. Among these patients, the
      all-cause mortality rate was 54.5%. A major clone - A1-ST442 (13/16) - was
      isolated during the study period. The BKC-1-producing isolates had a
      multi-drug-resistant phenotype, remaining susceptible to gentamicin
      (87.5%) and ceftazidime-avibactam (100%) alone. The presence of two
      carbapenemases - bla(BKC-1) and bla(KPC-2) - was detected in six isolates,
      increasing the β-lactam minimum inhibitory concentration significantly.
      Additionally, other ARGs were identified on A1-ST442 and B1-ST11 clones.
      The B1-ST11 clone was more virulent than the A1-ST442 clone. CONCLUSION:
      An undetected outbreak caused predominantly by a BKC-1-positive A1-ST442
      clone between 2010 and 2012 was identified 10 years later in a Brazilian
      hospital. The misidentification of BKC-1 may have worsened the spread of
      resistant clones; this reinforces the need for correct and rapid
      identification of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms in hospitals.

AB  - There is an urgent need for accurate and rapid diagnostic assays capable
      of identifying carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE). We
      assessed the performance of the RESIST-4 O.K.N.V. (OKNV) assay (Coris
      BioConcept, Gembloux, Belgium) for the identification of oxacillinase
      (OXA)-48-like-, Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-, New Delhi
      metallo-β-lactamase (NDM)-, and Verona integron-encoded
      metallo-β-lactamase (VIM)-producing Enterobacteriaceae grown on sheep
      blood agar (SBA) and the CHROMagar KPC medium. Sixty-five
      carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) isolates with characterized
      carbapenemase content were used to evaluate the OKNV assay. The assay
      correctly identified all 30 isolates that produced one of the four
      targeted carbapenemase families. Additionally, it correctly identified 15
      isolates that co-produced KPC and NDM, VIM and NDM or OXA-48-like and NDM,
      but failed to identify an NDM-1 and OXA-232 co-producing Klebsiella
      pneumoniae isolate. All 16 non-carbapenemase-producing CRE and four CPE
      isolates exhibited negative results, and no cross-reaction was observed.
      Overall, the sensitivity and specificity of the assay were 97.8% and 100%,
      respectively. The OKNV assay is an accurate and rapid assay for
      identifying OXA-48-like, KPC, NDM, and VIM carbapenemases produced by
      Enterobacteriaceae isolates cultured on both SBA and the CHROMagar KPC
      media in the clinical microbiology laboratory.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales are frequently
      involved in healthcare-associated infections worldwide. The objectives of
      this study were to investigate (i) the frequency of the main genes
      encoding carbapenemases, 16S rRNA methylases and aminoglycoside-modifying
      enzymes (AMEs) as well as the mcr gene and (ii) the clonal relationship of
      enterobacteria isolates resistant to carbapenems and aminoglycosides from
      colonisation and infection in patients from hospitals in northeastern
      Brazil. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using an
      automated VITEK®2 system. Presence of carbapenemase, AME and 16S rRNA
      methylase genes as well as the mcr gene was determined by PCR and amplicon
      sequencing. Genetic variability was determined by ERIC-PCR. RESULTS: A
      total of 35 isolates resistant to carbapenems and aminoglycosides were
      selected for this study. Klebsiella pneumoniae was most common (45.7%),
      followed by Proteus mirabilis (28.6%) and Serratia marcescens (25.7%). AME
      genes were found in 97.1% of isolates, most commonly aph(3')-VI and
      aac(6')-Ib. The bla(NDM-1) and bla(KPC-2) genes were detected in 25.7% and
      88.6% of isolates, respectively; five isolates harboured these genes
      concomitantly. According to the literature, this is the first report of
      the association of bla(NDM-1) and bla(KPC-2) in P. mirabilis and S.
      marcescens in Brazil. The isolates showed a multiclonal profile by
      ERIC-PCR. CONCLUSION: The emergence of bla(NDM-1) associated with
      bla(KPC-2) and AME genes in K. pneumoniae, P. mirabilis and S. marcescens
      isolates with a multiclonal profile is of concern as this limits
      therapeutic options. These results should alert medical authorities to
      establish rigorous detection methods to reduce the spread of these
      antimicrobial resistance genes.

AB  - Guidelines for the management of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales
      (CPE) infections recommend a combination of two active agents, including
      meropenem if the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) is ≤8 mg/L. The
      therapeutic equivalence of meropenem generics has been challenged. We
      compared the bactericidal activity of meropenem innovator (AstraZeneca)
      and four generic products (Actavis, Kabi, Mylan and Panpharma), both in
      vitro and in vivo, in association with colistin. In vitro time-kill
      studies were performed at 4 × MIC. An experimental model of KPC-producing
      Klebsiella pneumoniae osteomyelitis was induced in rabbits by tibial
      injection of a sclerosing agent followed by 2 × 10(8) CFU of K. pneumoniae
      KPC-99YC (meropenem MIC = 4 mg/L; colistin MIC = 1 mg/L). At 14 days after
      inoculation, treatment for 7 days started in seven groups of ≥10 rabbits,
      including a control group, a colistin group, and one group for each
      meropenem product (i.e. the innovator and four generics), in combination
      with colistin. In vitro, meropenem + colistin was bactericidal with no
      viable bacteria after 6 h, and this effect was similar with all meropenem
      products. In the osteomyelitis model, there was no significant difference
      between meropenem generics and the innovator when combined with colistin.
      Colistin-resistant strains were detected after treatment with colistin +
      meropenem innovator (n = 3) and generics (n = 3). The efficacy of four
      meropenem generics did not differ from the innovator in vitro and in an
      experimental rabbit model of KPC-producing K. pneumoniae osteomyelitis in
      terms of bactericidal activity and the emergence of resistance.

AB  - KPC-24, different from KPC-2 by a single amino acid alteration at codon 6
      (R6P), was initially discovered in Klebsiella pneumoniae in Chile. Here,
      we reported KPC-24-producing Aeromonas veronii isolates from hospital
      sewage in China. The bla(KPC-24) was cloned and the MICs were tested
      against β-lactams antimicrobial agents. KPC-24 exhibited a β-lactam
      susceptibility profile similar to that of KPC-2. Whole-genome sequencing
      and analysis revealed that bla(KPC-24) was located within a Tn6296-related
      region on an IncP-6 plasmid. IMPORTANCE Our study described a variant of
      K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), KPC-24, from two A. veronii strains
      isolated from hospital sewage, in which antibiotics, biocides,
      pharmaceuticals, and heavy metals may supply an appropriate condition for
      the evolution of carbapenemases. Some variants exhibited stronger
      hydrolysis activity to antibiotics and gave rise to a major public health
      concern. More seriously, Aeromonas species are prevalent in aquatic
      environments and, thus, may act as a suitable vector for
      antibiotics-resistance genes and foster the transmission of resistance. We
      should attach importance to surveying the evolution and transmission of
      antibiotics-resistance genes.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Recently, KPC-producing P. aeruginosa has rapidly emerged and
      expanded in East China. Here we described the clinical impact and
      characteristics of bloodstream infections (BSIs) from the dominant
      KPC-producing CRPA belonging to Sequence Type (ST) 463. METHODS:
      Retrospective cohort study was performed with CRPA BSI cases from 2019 to
      2020 in a hospital in East China. Clinical characteristics, risk factors,
      and all-course mortality were evaluated. All CRPA isolates had
      whole-genome sequencing, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, and serum
      resistance assay. Representative isolates were tested for virulence in a
      Galleria mellonella infection model. RESULTS: Among the 50 CRPA BSI cases,
      ST463 predominated (48.0%). In multivariate analysis, we found three
      independent risk factors for fatal outcome: KPC carriage (OR 4.8; CI95%
      1.0-23.7; P = 0.05), Pitt bacteremia score (OR 1.3; CI95% 1.0-1.6; P =
      0.02), and underlying hematological disease (OR 8.5; CI95% 1.6-46.4; P =
      0.01). The baseline clinical variables were not statistically different
      across STs, however the 28-day mortality was significantly higher in ST463
      cases than that in non-ST463 cases (66.7% vs 33.3%, P = 0.03). ExoU and
      exoS virulence genes coexisted in all ST463 isolates, and the carbapenem
      resistant gene bla(KPC) were produced in almost all ST463 isolates,
      significantly higher than in the non-ST463 group(95.8% vs 7.7%, P<0.001).
      ST463 CRPA isolates also showed higher resistance rates to antipseudomonal
      cephalosporins, monobactam, and fluoroquinolones. And ST463 CRPA was
      confirmed hypervirulence in the larvae model. The genome of one ST463 CRPA
      strain showed that the bla(KPC-2) gene was the sole resistance gene
      located on a 41,104bp plasmid pZYPA01, carried on a 7-kb composite
      transposon-like element flanked by two IS26 elements
      (IS26-Tn3-tnpA-ISKpn27-bla(KPC-2)-ISKpn6-IS26). Plasmid from various
      species presented core bla(KPC-2) was franked by mobile genetic element
      ISKpn27 and ISKpn6. CONCLUSIONS: In the ST463 CRPA BSI cohort, the
      mortality rates were higher than those in the non-ST463 CRPA BSI. The
      ST463 CRPA clone coharboring the bla(KPC) and exoU/exoS genes emerged and
      spread in East China, which might develop to a new threat in the clinic.
      Our results suggest that the surveillance of the new high-risk clone,
      ST463 CRPA, should be strengthened in China, even worldwide in the future.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: A MALDI-TOF MS-based identification method for KPC-producing
      Enterobacterales was developed. METHODS: The molecular mass of the intact
      KPC-2 polypeptide was estimated for blaKPC-2 transformants using MALDI
      Microflex and the exact mass was confirmed by LC and a high-resolution
      MS/MS system. A total of 1181 clinical Enterobacterales strains, including
      369 KPC producers and 812 KPC non-producers, were used to set up the
      methodology and the results were compared with those from PCR analyses.
      For external validation, a total of 458 Enterobacterales clinical isolates
      from a general hospital between December 2018 and April 2019 were used.
      RESULTS: The exact molecular mass of the intact KPC-2 protein was 28
      718.13 Da and KPC peaks were observed at m/z 28 708.87-28 728.34 using
      MALDI Microflex. Most of the KPC-2 (99.1%, 335/338) and KPC-3 (100%, 6/6)
      producers presented a clear peak via this method, while 12.0% (3/25) of
      the KPC-4 producers had a peak of weak intensity associated with low
      levels of gene expression. It took less than 20 min for the entire assay
      to be performed with colonies on an agar plate. External validation showed
      that the analytical sensitivity and specificity of the method compared
      with PCR were 100% (59/59) and 99.50% (397/399), respectively.
      CONCLUSIONS: The MALDI-TOF MS-based method for directly detecting the
      intact KPC protein is applicable to routine tests in clinical microbiology
      laboratories, supported by its speed, low cost and excellent sensitivity
      and specificity.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Klebsiella pneumoniae is an opportunistic pathogen that has
      been implicated as one of commonest cause of hospital and community
      acquired infections. The K. pneumoniae infections have considerably
      contributed to morbidity and mortality in patients with protracted
      ailments. The capacity of K. pneumoniae to cause diseases depends on the
      presence of an array virulence factors. Coexistence and expression of
      virulence factors and genetic determinants of antibiotic resistance
      complicates treatment outcomes. Thus, emergence of pathogenic MDR K.
      pneumoniae poses a great threat to the healthcare system. However, the
      carriage of antibiotic resistance among pathogenic K. pneumoniae is yet to
      be investigated in Uganda. We sought to investigate the carbapenem
      resistance profiles and pathogenic potential based on capsular serotypes
      of K. pneumoniae clinical isolates. METHODS: This was a cross sectional
      study involving use of archived Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates collected
      between January and December, 2019 at four tertiary hospitals in Uganda.
      All isolates were subject to antimicrobial susceptibility assays to
      determine phenotypic antibiotic resistance, pentaplex PCR to detect
      carbapenemases encoding genes and heptaplex PCR to identify capsular
      serotypes K1, K2, K3, K5, K20, K54 and K57. RESULTS: The study found an
      overall phenotypic carbapenem resistance of 23.3% (53/227) and
      significantly higher genotypic resistance prevalence of 43.1% (98/227).
      Over all, the most prevalent gene was bla(OXA-48-like) (36.4%), followed
      by bla(IMP-type) (19.4%), bla(VIM-type) (17.1%), bla(KPC-type) (14.0%) and
      bla(NDM-type) (13.2%). bla(VIM-type) and bla(OXA-48-like) conferred
      phenotypic resistance in all isolates and 38.3% of isolates that harbored
      them respectively. Capsular multiplex PCR revealed that 46.7% (106/227)
      isolates were pathogenic and the predominantly prevalent pathotype was K5
      (18.5%) followed by K20 (15.1%), K3 (7.1%), K2 (3.1%) and K1 (2.2%). Of
      the 106 capsular serotypes, 37 expressed phenotypic resistance; thus, 37
      of the 53 carbapenem resistant K. pneumoniae were pathogenic. CONCLUSION:
      The high prevalence of virulent and antibiotic resistant K. pneumoniae
      among clinical isolates obtained from the four tertiary hospital as
      revealed by this study pose a great threat to healthcare. Our findings
      underline the epidemiological and public health risks and implications of
      this pathogen.

AB  - The global emergence and spread of genes responsible for the production of
      ESBL (extended-spectrum beta-lactamases) and carbapenemases in Klebsiella
      pneumoniae isolates poses a serious threat to public health. The aim of
      this study was to retrospectively analyze the frequency of occurrence and
      drug resistance of selected alarm agents isolated from patients of the
      specialist hospital in Wrocław. A total of 13,528 clinical materials
      collected from patients of a specialist hospital in Wrocław were analyzed
      in the period from 1 January 2020 to 31 December 2020. Overall, 3894
      bacterial strains were isolated from clinical materials, including 416 K.
      pneumoniae isolates. K. pneumoniae that showed resistance to ETP
      (ertapenem) and/or MEM (meropenem) were tested using phenotypic tests for
      the detection of KPC (carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella), MBL
      (metallo-β-lactamase) and OXA-48 (oxacilinase-48) carbapenemases. In the
      case of a positive or doubtful result of the phenotypic test,
      immunochromatographic tests and the CarbaNP test were performed. In total,
      58 K. pneumoniae isolates resistant to 1 or more carbapenem antibiotics
      were isolated. Of the 58 strains, 16 (27.6%) were isolated from rectal
      swabs conducted on CPE (carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae)
      carriers. In the case of CRE (carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae) K.
      pneumoniae, carbapenemases were detected in 28/58 (48.3%) isolates.
      Notably, 23/28 K. pneumoniae isolates produced MBL/NDM (New Delhi
      metallo-β-lactamase) (82.1%), 5/28 produced VIM (Verona-intergon-encoded
      metallo-β-lactamase) (14.3%), and one produced MBL/NDM + OXA-48.
      Carbapenemases were detected in 13 of 16 (81.3%) carbapenem-resistant K.
      pneumoniae isolates derived from rectal swabs. The significant
      participation of CRE and CPE isolates in the infections proves the need to
      test patients admitted to hospital wards for their status as a CPE carrier
      in order to limit the emergence of new epidemic outbreaks.

AB  - Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) infection is highly endemic in
      China; Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) 2-producing CRE is the
      most common, whereas KPC-3-producing CRE is rare. We report an outbreak of
      KPC-3-producing Enterobacterales infection in China. During August
      2020-June 2021, 25 bla(KPC-3)-positive Enterobacteriale isolates were
      detected from 24 patients in China. Whole-genome sequencing analysis
      revealed that the bla(KPC-3) genes were harbored by IncX8 plasmids. The
      outbreak involved clonal expansion of KPC-3-producing Serratia marcescens
      and transmission of bla(KPC-3) plasmids across different species. The
      bla(KPC-3) plasmids demonstrated high conjugation frequencies (10(-3) to
      10(-4)). A Galleria mellonella infection model showed that 2 sequence type
      65 K2 K. pneumoniae strains containing bla(KPC-3) plasmids were highly
      virulent. A ceftazidime/avibactam in vitro selection assay indicated that
      the KPC-3-producing strains can readily develop resistance. The spread of
      bla(KPC-3)-harboring IncX8 plasmids and these KPC-3 strains should be
      closely monitored in China and globally.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Due to the critical condition and poor immunity of patients,
      the intensive care unit (ICU) has always been the main hospital source of
      multidrug-resistant bacteria. In recent years, with the large-scale use of
      antibiotics, the detection rate and mortality of carbapenem-resistant
      Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) have gradually increased. This study explores
      the molecular characteristics and prevalence of CRKP isolated from the ICU
      ward of a tertiary hospital in China. METHODS: A total of 51
      non-duplicated CRKP samples isolated from the ICU were collected from July
      2018-July 2020. The enzyme production of the strains was preliminarily
      screened by carbapenemase phenotypic test, and drug-resistant and
      virulence genes were detected by PCR. The transferability of plasmid was
      verified by conjugation test. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC)
      was determined by microbroth dilution method and genetic diversity was
      detected by multilocus sequence typing and pulsed-field gel
      electrophoresis. RESULTS: bla(KPC-2) was the only carbapenemase detected.
      The major virulence genes were uge (100%), mrkD (94.1%), kpn (94.1%), and
      fim-H (72.5%), while wcag, ironB, alls and magA genes were not detected.
      One sequence type ST1373 strain, hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKP), was
      detected. CRKP strains were highly resistant to quinolones,
      cephalosporins, aminoglycosides, and polymyxin, but susceptive to
      tigecycline and ceftazidime-avibactam. The success rate of conjugation was
      12.2%, indicating the horizontal transfer of bla(KPC-2) . Homology
      analysis showed that there was a clonal transmission of ST11 CRKP in the
      ICU of our hospital. CONCLUSION: The present study showed the outbreak and
      dissemination in ICU were caused by ST11 CRKP, which were KPC-2 producers,
      and simultaneously, also carried some virulence genes. ST11 CRKP persisted
      in the ward for a long time and spread among different areas. Due to the
      widespread dispersal of the transferable bla(KPC-2) plasmid, the hospital
      should promptly adopt effective surveillance and strict infection control
      strategies to prevent the further spread of CRKP. Ceftazidime-avibactam
      showed high effectiveness against CRKP and could be used for the treatment
      of ICU infections.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to evaluate the concordance between epidemiologically
      determined transmission and genetic linkage of Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-Kp). METHODS: We
      included consecutive KPC-Kp carriers between December 2016 and April 2017
      in a hospital endemic for KPC-Kp. We assessed epidemiological relatedness
      between patients by prospective investigations by the infection control
      team. The probability of epidemiological relatedness was classified into
      four groups: no suspected transmission, low, moderate and high probability
      of transmission. Whole-genome sequencing of isolates was performed.
      Genetic linkage between KPC-Kp isolates was expressed by distance between
      isolates in single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We established an SNP
      cut-off defining a different strain based on the reconstructed
      phylogenetic tree. We compared the epidemiological and genetic linkage of
      all isolates from all patients. RESULTS: The study included 25 KPC-Kp
      carriers with 49 isolates. SNP variance was available for 1129 crossed
      patient-isolate pairs. Genomic linkage, based on a cut-off of 80 SNPs to
      define related isolates, was found in 115/708 (16.2%) of isolates with no
      transmission suspected epidemiologically, 27/319 (8.5%) of low, 11/26
      (42.3%) of moderate and 64/76 (84.2%) of high epidemiological transmission
      risk determination (p < 0.001 for trend). Similar results and significant
      trends were shown on sensitivity analyses using a lower SNP cut-off (six
      SNPs) and patient-isolate unique pairs, analysing the first isolate from
      each patient. CONCLUSIONS: While significant concordance between
      epidemiological and genomic transmission patterns was found,
      epidemiological investigations of transmission are limited by the
      possibility of unidentified transmissions or over-estimation of
      associations. Genetic linkage analysis is an important aid to
      epidemiological transmission assessment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) is a common pathogen
      associated with hospital and community-onset infections. This study aimed
      to compare the clinical and microbiological characteristics of nosocomial,
      healthcare-associated (HCA), and community-acquired (CA) K. pneumoniae
      infections. METHODS: Clinical data were extracted from electronic medical
      records and analyzed retrospectively. Antimicrobial susceptibility and
      extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) production were determined for all
      identified strains. Carbapenemase and ESBL genes were amplified by PCR.
      Genotyping of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP) and ESBL-producing
      strains was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). RESULTS:
      Of 379 K. pneumoniae infections, 98 (25.9%) were nosocomial, 195 (51.5%)
      were healthcare-associated, and 86 (22.6%) were community-acquired.
      Hematological malignancy (OR = 4.467), and hypertension (OR = 2.08) and
      cerebral vascular disease (OR = 2.486) were associated with nosocomial and
      HCA infections respectively, when compared to CA infections. Overall, the
      incidence of antimicrobial resistance for the majority of agents tested
      was similar between nosocomial and HCA infections (P > 0.05) and both
      groups had a higher incidence than CA infections (P < 0.05). Moreover,
      95.1% (78/82) of CRKP strains were isolated from the nosocomial and HCA
      groups. The bla(KPC) was the most prevalent carbapenemase gene among CRKP
      strains (80.5%, 66/82). ESBL-producing strains were prevalent among
      nosocomial (40.8%), HCA (35.9%) and CA groups (24.4%). The
      bla(CTX-M-9-group) and bla(CTX-M-1-group) genes were predominant in
      nosocomial (65.0%) and CA strains (66.7%), respectively. PFGE results
      showed ESBL-producing and CRKP strains were genetically diverse. Identical
      PFGE profiles were observed among HCA and nosocomial strains. CONCLUSIONS:
      Nosocomial and HCA K. pneumoniae infections presented similar clinical
      features and antimicrobial resistance, and both two types of infections
      were different to CA infections. CRKP and ESBL-producing strains were
      disseminated mainly in HCA and nosocomial groups, and showed a clonal
      diversity. The cross transmission of CRKP was existed among HCA and
      nosocomial patients. This finding suggests that similar empirical therapy
      should be considered for patients with nosocomial and HCA K. pneumoniae
      infections and bacterial resistance surveillance of these infections is
      necessary.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sink drains in healthcare facilities may provide an
      environment for antimicrobial-resistant microorganisms, including
      carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (CPKP). METHODS: We
      investigated the colonization of a biofilm consortia by CPKP in a model
      system simulating a sink-drain P-trap. Centers for Disease Control (CDC)
      biofilm reactors (CBRs) were inoculated with microbial consortia
      originally recovered from 2 P-traps collected from separate patient rooms
      (designated rooms A and B) in a hospital. Biofilms were grown on stainless
      steel (SS) or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) coupons in autoclaved municipal
      drinking water (ATW) for 7 or 28 days. RESULTS: Microbial communities in
      model systems (designated CBR-A or CBR-B) were less diverse than
      communities in respective P-traps A and B, and they were primarily
      composed of β and γ Proteobacteria, as determined using 16S rRNA community
      analysis. Following biofilm development CBRs were inoculated with either
      K. pneumoniae ST45 (ie, strain CAV1016) or K. pneumoniae ST258 KPC+ (ie,
      strain 258), and samples were collected over 21 days. Under most
      conditions tested (CBR-A: SS, 7-day biofilm; CBR-A: PVC, 28-day biofilm;
      CBR-B: SS, 7-day and 28-day biofilm; CBR-B: PVC, 28-day biofilm)
      significantly higher numbers of CAV1016 were observed compared to 258.
      CAV1016 showed no significant difference in quantity or persistence based
      on biofilm age (7 days vs 28 days) or substratum type (SS vs PVC).
      However, counts of 258 were significantly higher on 28-day biofilms and on
      SS. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that CPKP persistence in P-trap
      biofilms may be strain specific or may be related to the type of P-trap
      material or age of the biofilm.

AB  - Introduction: Multi-drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae is currently one
      of the most pressing emerging issues in bacterial resistance. Treatment of
      K.pneumoniae infections is often problematic due to the lack of available
      therapeutic options, with a relevant impact in terms of morbidity,
      mortality and healthcare-associated costs. Soon after the launch of
      Ceftazidime-Avibactam, one of the approved new β-lactam/β-lactamase
      inhibitor combinations, reports of ceftazidime-avibactam-resistant strains
      developing resistance during treatment were published. Being a
      hospital-associated pathogen, K.pneumoniae is continuously exposed to
      multiple antibiotics resulting in constant selective pressure, which in
      turn leads to additional mutations that are positively selected.Areas
      covered: Herein the authors present the K.pneumoniae mechanisms of
      resistance to different antimicrobials, including updated data for
      ceftazidime-avibactam.Expert opinion: K.pneumoniae is a nosocomial
      pathogen commonly implicated in hospital outbreaks with a propensity for
      antimicrobial resistance toward mainstay β-lactam antibiotics and multiple
      other antibiotic classes. Following the development of drug resistance and
      understanding the mechanisms involved, we can improve the efficacy of
      current antimicrobials, by applying careful stewardship and rational use
      to preserve their potential utility. The knowledge on antibiotic
      resistance mechanisms should be used to inform the design of novel
      therapeutic agents that might not be subject to, or can circumvent,
      mechanisms of resistance.

AB  - Carbapenem resistance in Enterobacterales is a public health threat.
      Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (encoded by alleles of the bla(KPC)
      family) is one of the most common transmissible carbapenem resistance
      mechanisms worldwide. The dissemination of bla(KPC) historically has been
      associated with distinct K. pneumoniae lineages (clonal group 258
      [CG258]), a particular plasmid family (pKpQIL), and a composite transposon
      (Tn4401). In the United Kingdom, bla(KPC) has represented a large-scale,
      persistent management challenge for some hospitals, particularly in North
      West England. The dissemination of bla(KPC) has evolved to be polyclonal
      and polyspecies, but the genetic mechanisms underpinning this evolution
      have not been elucidated in detail; this study used short-read
      whole-genome sequencing of 604 bla(KPC)-positive isolates (Illumina) and
      long-read assembly (PacBio)/polishing (Illumina) of 21 isolates for
      characterization. We observed the dissemination of bla(KPC) (predominantly
      bla(KPC-2); 573/604 [95%] isolates) across eight species and more than 100
      known sequence types. Although there was some variation at the transposon
      level (mostly Tn4401a, 584/604 [97%] isolates; predominantly with
      ATTGA-ATTGA target site duplications, 465/604 [77%] isolates), bla(KPC)
      spread appears to have been supported by highly fluid, modular exchange of
      larger genetic segments among plasmid populations dominated by IncFIB
      (580/604 isolates), IncFII (545/604 isolates), and IncR (252/604 isolates)
      replicons. The subset of reconstructed plasmid sequences (21 isolates, 77
      plasmids) also highlighted modular exchange among non-bla(KPC) and
      bla(KPC) plasmids and the common presence of multiple replicons within
      bla(KPC) plasmid structures (>60%). The substantial genomic plasticity
      observed has important implications for our understanding of the
      epidemiology of transmissible carbapenem resistance in Enterobacterales
      for the implementation of adequate surveillance approaches and for
      control.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Ertapenem has proven to be an effective antimicrobial;
      however, increasing enzyme-mediated resistance has been noted. Combination
      with zidebactam, a β-lactam enhancer, is restorative. Human-simulated
      regimens (HSRs) of ertapenem and zidebactam alone and in combination (WCK
      6777; 2 g/2 g q24h) were assessed for efficacy against
      carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (CP-KP) in the pneumonia
      model. METHODS: Infected ICR mice were rendered neutropenic and exposed to
      various doses of ertapenem and zidebactam alone and in combination to
      develop the HSRs that were subsequently confirmed in additional
      pharmacokinetic studies. Twenty-one CP-KP (KPC or OXA-48-like producers)
      with WCK 6777 MICs of 1-8 mg/L were utilized. Mice were treated for 24 h
      with saline or HSRs of ertapenem, zidebactam and WCK 6777. Efficacy was
      defined as change in mean lung bacterial density relative to 0 h. RESULTS:
      Confirmatory pharmacokinetic analysis showed agreement between predicted
      human exposures (%fT>MIC) and those achieved in vivo for all three HSRs.
      The 0 h bacterial density across all isolates was 6.69 ± 0.31 log10
      cfu/lungs. At 24 h, densities increased by 2.57 ± 0.50, 2.2 ± 0.60 and
      2.05 ± 0.71 log10 cfu/lungs in the 24 h control, ertapenem HSR and
      zidebactam HSR groups, respectively. Overall, 18/21 of the isolates
      exposed to the WCK 6777 HSR displayed a killing profile that exceeded the
      translational benchmark for efficacy of a 1 log10 cfu reduction. Among the
      remaining three isolates, two displayed ∼0.5 log10 kill and stasis was
      observed in the third. CONCLUSIONS: Human-simulated exposures of WCK 6777
      demonstrated potent in vivo activity against CP-KP, including those with
      WCK 6777 MICs up to 8 mg/L.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to identify clonally-related
      carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae complex members that could
      be involved in outbreaks among hospitalized patients in Denmark, and to
      identify possible epidemiological links. METHODS: From January 2014 to
      June 2018, 103 isolates belonging to the K. pneumoniae complex were
      collected from 102 patients. From the whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data,
      presence of genes encoding carbapenemase and multilocal sequence typing
      (MLST) data were extracted. Core genome MLST (cgMLST) cluster analysis was
      performed. Using data from the Danish National Patient Registry (DNPR) and
      reported travel history, presumptive outbreaks were investigated for
      possible epidemiological links. RESULTS: The most common detected
      carbapenemase gene was bla(OXA-48), followed by bla(NDM-1.) The 103 K.
      pneumoniae complex isolates belonged to 47 sequence types (STs) and cgMLST
      subdivided the isolates into 80 different complex types. cgMLST identified
      13 clusters with 2-4 isolates per cluster. For five of the 13 clusters, a
      direct link (the patients stayed at the same ward on the same day) could
      be detected between at least some of the patients. In two clusters, the
      patients resided simultaneously at the same hospital, but not the same
      ward. A possible link (same ward within 1-13 days) was detected for the
      patients in one cluster. For five clusters detected by cgMLST, no
      epidemiological link could be detected using data from DNPR. CONCLUSION:
      In this study, cgMLST combined with patient hospital admission data and
      travel information was found to be a reliable and detailed approach to
      detect possible clonal transmission of carbapenemase-producing K.
      pneumoniae complex members.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-KP) is an
      urgent public health issue in Italy. This pattern of resistance is due
      mainly to dissemination of carbapenemase genes. Molecular characterization
      of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-KP) strains was
      performed over a three-year period. In-depth analysis was performed on a
      subset of emerging CR-KP ST101 and ST307 clones. METHODS: A prospective
      study was performed on 691 patients with CR-KP bloodstream infections
      hospitalized in 19 hospitals located in three large provinces in Southern
      Italy. Carbapenemase genes were identified via genotyping methods.
      Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) were
      carried out on ST101 and ST307 isolates. RESULTS: Among the CR-KP
      isolates, bla(KPC) was found in 95.6%, bla(VIM) was found in 3.5%,
      bla(NDM) was found in 0.1% and bla(OXA-48) was found in 0.1%. The
      bla(KPC-3) variant was identified in all 104 characterized KPC-KP
      isolates. MLST of 231 representative isolates revealed ST512 in 45.5%,
      ST101 in 20.3% and ST307 in 18.2% of the isolates. cgMLST of ST307 and
      ST101 isolates revealed presence of more than one beta-lactam resistance
      gene. Amino acid substitution in the chromosomal colistin-resistance gene
      pmrB was found in two ST101 isolates. CONCLUSIONS: ST512 is widespread in
      Southern Italy, but ST101 and ST307 are emerging since they were found in
      a significant proportion of cases. Aggressive infection control measures
      and a continuous monitoring of these high-risk clones are necessary to
      avoid rapid spread of CR-KP, especially in hospital settings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bloodstream infections (BSIs) by Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) are associated
      with high mortality. The aim of this study is to assess the relationship
      between time to administration of appropriate antibiotic therapy and the
      outcome of patients with BSI due to KPC-Kp hospitalized in intensive care
      unit (ICU). METHODS: An observational study was conducted in the ICUs of
      two academic centers in Italy. Patients with KPC-Kp bacteremia
      hospitalized between January 2015 to December 2018 were included. The
      primary outcome was the relationship between time from blood cultures (BC)
      collection to appropriate antibiotic therapy and 30-day mortality. The
      secondary outcome was to evaluate the association of different treatment
      regimens with 30-day mortality and a composite endpoint (30-day mortality
      or nephrotoxicity). A Cox regression analysis to identify factors
      independently associated with 30-day mortality was performed. Hazard ratio
      (HR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) were calculated. RESULTS: A total of
      102 patients with KPC-Kp BSI were included. The most common sources of
      infection were intra-abdominal (23.5%), urinary tract (20.6%), and skin
      and skin structure (17.6%). The 30-day mortality was 45%. Median time to
      appropriate antibiotic therapy was shorter in patients who survived (8.5 h
      [IQR 1-36]) versus those who died (48 h [IQR 5-108], p = 0.014). A
      propensity score matching showed that receipt of an in vitro active
      therapy within 24 h from BC collection was associated with lower 30-day
      mortality (HR = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.188-0.690, p = 0.0021). At Cox regression
      analysis, factors associated with 30-day mortality were primary bacteremia
      (HR 2.662 [95% CI 1.118-6.336], p = 0.027), cardiovascular disease (HR
      2.196 [95% CI 1.082-4.457], p = 0.029), time (24-h increments) from BC
      collection to appropriate therapy (HR 1.382 [95% CI 1.132-1.687], p =
      0.001), SOFA score (HR 1.122 [95% CI 1.036-1.216], p = 0.005), and age (HR
      1.030 [95% CI 1.006-1.054], p = 0.012). Ceftazidime-avibactam-containing
      regimens were associated with reduced risk of composite endpoint (30-day
      mortality OR nephrotoxicity) (HR 0.231 [95% CI 0.071-0.745], p = 0.014)
      compared to colistin-containing regimens. CONCLUSIONS: Time to appropriate
      antibiotic therapy is an independent predictor of 30-day mortality in
      patients with KPC-Kp BSI. Appropriate antibiotic therapy should begin
      within 24 h from the collection of BC.

AB  - Background: The emergence and wide global spread of carbapenem-resistant
      Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) isolates are of great concern, and the aim of
      this study was to investigate drug resistance, molecular epidemiology, and
      genetic relationship of CRKP isolates from patients in Shanghai, China.
      Methods: A retrospective study was conducted from April 2018 to July 2019,
      and a total of 133 CRKP isolates were collected. Antimicrobial
      susceptibility was determined by VITEK-2 automated microbiology analyzer
      platform (bioMérieux, France) and the broth microdilution method.
      Polymerase chain reaction assays were used to investigate the presence of
      drug resistance genes. A modified carbapenem inactivation method was
      performed to detect carbapenemases. Multilocus sequence typing and
      pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) were conducted for genetic
      relatedness of 50 CRKP isolates selected. Results: Among 670 isolates of
      K. pneumoniae, 133 (19.9%) strains were identified as CRKP, of which,
      76.7% (102/133) strains were isolated from intensive care units (ICUs).
      All the 133 CRKP isolates were found to be carbapenemase-producers and
      harbor blaKPC-2 gene. No other carbapenemase genes of blaNDM, blaOXA-48,
      blaVIM, and blaIMP were detected. Furthermore, β-lactamase genes of
      blaSHV, blaCTX, and blaTEM were the most common resistance-associated
      genes among these KPC-2 producing isolates. All the 133 CRKP strains
      displayed >95% of resistance to cephalosporins and carbapenems, except for
      gentamicin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, amikacin, tigecycline and
      colistin, and ceftazidime-avibactam. The most common sequence type was
      ST11, accounting for 90.0% of the 50 CRKP selected, followed by ST15
      (10.0%). PFGE analysis clustered the 50 KPC-2-producing isolates into
      seven (A-G) distinct clonal clusters at 85% cutoff. Of which, A and G were
      the two major clusters, accounting for the majority of the strains
      collected in emergency ICU and neurosurgical ICU. And all the strains of
      clusters D and E were collected in cardiothoracic surgery ICU, except for
      one strain collected in one outpatient. Conclusion: The KPC-2-producing K.
      pneumoniae belonged to ST11 was widely disseminated in ICUs, and active
      and effective surveillance of infection control strategies was initiated
      to limit the spread of CRKP strains.

AB  - Recently, new combinations of β-lactams and β-lactamase inhibitors became
      available, including ceftazidime-avibactam, and increased the ability to
      treat infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE).
      Despite the reduced time of clinical use, isolates expressing resistance
      to ceftazidime-avibactam have been reported, even during treatment or in
      patients with no previous contact with this drug. Here, we detailed review
      data on global ceftazidime-avibactam susceptibility, the mechanisms
      involved in resistance, and the molecular epidemiology of resistant
      isolates. Ceftazidime-avibactam susceptibility remains high (≥ 98.4%)
      among Enterobacterales worldwide, being lower among extended-spectrum
      β-lactamase (ESBL) producers and CRE. Alterations in class A β-lactamases
      are the major mechanism involved in ceftazidime-avibactam resistance, and
      mutations are mainly, but not exclusively, located in the Ω loop of these
      enzymes. Modifications in Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) 3 and
      KPC-2 have been observed by many authors, generating variants with
      different mutations, insertions, and/or deletions. Among these, the most
      commonly described is Asp179Tyr, both in KPC-3 (KPC-31 variant) and in
      KPC-2 (KPC-33 variant). Changes in membrane permeability and
      overexpression of efflux systems may also be associated with
      ceftazidime-avibactam resistance. Although several clones have been
      reported, ST258 with Asp179Tyr deserves special attention. Surveillance
      studies and rationale use are essential to retaining the activity of this
      and other antimicrobials against class A CRE.

AB  - Aim: This study reports the characterization of carbapenem-resistant
      colonizing strains of K. pneumoniae. Methods: 650 stool samples were
      screened for carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CR-Kp). All strains were
      characterized for antibiotic susceptibility, typing features, main
      carbapenemases and extended-spectrum ß-lactamases. The carbapenemase
      transferability was assessed by interspecific conjugation. Results:
      Eighteen CR-Kp were multidrug resistant, five were KPC producing. A
      predominance of ST307 isolates, constituting the predominant cluster by
      PFGE analysis, was identified (50% were KPC-2 producers). Conjugation data
      showed the co-transfer of blaKPC-2, blaTEM-1, blaOXA-1, blaCTX-M-15 in a
      single large pKPN3-like plasmid. Conclusion: Our data pointed out the
      diversity of colonizing K. pneumoniae strains compared with clinical ones.
      The predominance of ST307 strains suggested an increased spreading, even
      in our area, of this high-risk clone.

      colonization of sink P-traps by carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella
      pneumoniae (CPKP), causing CPKP dispersal into the patient care
      environment. This study aimed to determine the effect of LW on biofilm
      formation and CPKP colonization in a P-Trap model (PTM). PTMs containing
      polymicrobial biofilms grown in autoclaved municipal tap water (ATW)
      supplemented with 5% dextrose in water (D5W), nutritional shake (Shake),
      sugar-based soft drink (Soda), or ATW were inoculated with K. pneumoniae
      ST258 KPC+ (ST258) or K. pneumoniae CAV1016 (CAV1016) and sampled after 7,
      14, and 21 d. Biofilm bio-volume, mean thickness, and heterotrophic plate
      counts were significantly reduced and roughness coefficient significantly
      increased by Soda compared with D5W, Shake, or ATW. CPKP were
      significantly reduced by Soda but significantly amplified by D5W (ST258;
      CAV1016, 7 d) and Shake (ST258) suggesting that reducing LW disposal in
      sinks may reduce CPKP dispersal into patient care environments.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study investigated the genetic environment of bla KPC-2
      in Klebsiella pnemoniae multi-drug resistant clinical isolates. METHODS:
      Four carbapenemase gene isolates resistant to carbapenems, collected from
      infected patients from two hospitals in Brazil, were investigated using
      polymerase chain reaction and plasmid DNA sequencing. RESULTS: The bla
      KPC-2 gene was located between ISKpn6 and a resolvase tnpR in the
      non-Tn4401 element (NTEKPC-IId). It was detected on a plasmid belonging to
      the IncQ1 group. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this is the first report
      of the presence of the bla KPC-2 gene in the NTEKPC-IId element carried by
      plasmid IncQ1 from infections in Brazil.

AB  - Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strains cause severe infections
      that are difficult to treat. The production of carbapenemases such as the
      K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) is a common mechanism by which these
      strains resist killing by the carbapenems. However, the degree of
      phenotypic carbapenem resistance (MIC) may differ markedly between
      isolates with similar carbapenemase genes, suggesting that our
      understanding of the underlying mechanisms of carbapenem resistance
      remains incomplete. To address this problem, we determined the
      whole-genome sequences of 166 K. pneumoniae clinical isolates resistant to
      meropenem, imipenem, or ertapenem. Multiple linear regression analysis of
      this collection of largely bla(KPC-3)-containing sequence type 258 (ST258)
      isolates indicated that bla(KPC) copy number and some outer membrane porin
      gene mutations were associated with higher MICs to carbapenems. A trend
      toward higher MICs was also observed with those bla(KPC) genes carried by
      the d isoform of Tn4401. In contrast, ompK37 mutations were associated
      with lower carbapenem MICs, and extended spectrum β-lactamase genes were
      not associated with higher or lower MICs in carbapenem-resistant K.
      pneumoniae. A machine learning approach based on the whole-genome
      sequences of these isolates did not result in a substantial improvement in
      prediction of isolates with high or low MICs. These results build upon
      previous findings suggesting that multiple factors influence the overall
      carbapenem resistance levels in carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae
      isolates. IMPORTANCE Klebsiella pneumoniae can cause severe infections in
      the blood, urinary tract, and lungs. Resistance to carbapenems in K.
      pneumoniae is an urgent public health threat, since it can make these
      isolates difficult to treat. While individual contributors to carbapenem
      resistance in K. pneumoniae have been studied, few reports explore their
      combined effects in clinical isolates. We sequenced 166 clinical
      carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates to evaluate the contribution
      of known genes to carbapenem MICs and to try to identify novel genes
      associated with higher carbapenem MICs. The bla(KPC) copy number and some
      outer membrane porin gene mutations were associated with higher carbapenem
      MICs. In contrast, mutations in one specific porin, ompK37, were
      associated with lower carbapenem MICs. Machine learning did not result in
      a substantial improvement in the prediction of carbapenem resistance nor
      did it identify novel genes associated with carbapenem resistance. These
      findings enhance our understanding of the many contributors to carbapenem
      resistance in K. pneumoniae.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae has become a
      global priority, not least in low- and middle-income countries. Here, we
      report the emergence and clinical impact of a novel Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae (KPC-KP) sequence type (ST) 16 clone
      in a clonal complex (CC) 258-endemic setting. METHODS: In a teaching
      Brazilian hospital, a retrospective cohort of adult KPC-KP bloodstream
      infection (BSI) cases (January 2014 to December 2016) was established to
      study the molecular epidemiology and its impact on outcome (30-day
      all-cause mortality). KPC-KP isolates underwent multilocus sequence
      typing. Survival analysis between ST/CC groups and risk factors for fatal
      outcome (logistic regression) were evaluated. Representative isolates
      underwent whole-genome sequencing and had their virulence tested in a
      Galleria larvae model. RESULTS: One hundred sixty-five unique KPC-KP BSI
      cases were identified. CC258 was predominant (66%), followed by ST16
      (12%). The overall 30-day mortality rate was 60%; in contrast, 95% of ST16
      cases were fatal. Patients' severity scores were high and baseline
      clinical variables were not statistically different across STs. In
      multivariate analysis, ST16 (odds ratio [OR], 21.4; 95% confidence
      interval [CI], 2.3-202.8; P = .008) and septic shock (OR, 11.9; 95% CI,
      4.2-34.1; P < .001) were independent risk factors for fatal outcome. The
      ST16 clone carried up to 14 resistance genes, including blaKPC-2 in an
      IncFIBpQIL plasmid, KL51 capsule, and yersiniabactin virulence
      determinants. The ST16 clone was highly pathogenic in the larvae model.
      CONCLUSIONS: Mortality rates were high in this KPC-KP BSI cohort, where
      CC258 is endemic. An emerging ST16 clone was associated with high
      mortality. Our results suggest that even in endemic settings, highly
      virulent clones can rapidly emerge demanding constant monitoring.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo effects
      of different combinations of antimicrobial agents against
      carbapenemase-producing and non-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae from
      China. METHODS: A checkerboard assay of meropenem (MEM), amikacin (AK),
      tigecycline (TGC), colistin (COL) and their combinations was carried out
      against 58 clinical carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKp) isolates,
      including 11 carbapenemase-non-producing K. pneumoniae isolates and 21
      isolates producing KPC-2 enzyme, 11 NDM-1, 13 IMP, one VIM-1 and one
      OXA-48. The checkerboard assay was analyzed by the fractional inhibitory
      concentration index (FICI). A time-kill assay and Galleria mellonella
      infection model were conducted to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo
      effects of the four drugs alone and in combination. RESULTS: In the
      checkerboard assay, TGC+AK and MEM+AK combinations showed the highest
      synergistic effect against KPC-2 and NDM-1 carbapenemase-producing
      isolates, with synergy+partial synergy (defined as FICI <1) rates of 76.2%
      and 71.4% against KPC-2 producers, and 54.5% and 81.8% against NDM-1
      producers. TGC+AK and MEM+COL combinations showed the highest rate of
      synergistic effect against IMP-producing isolates. Against
      carbapenemase-non-producing isolates, TGC+COL and TGC+AK combinations
      showed the highest rate of synergy effect (63.6% and 54.5%). MEM+AK showed
      a synergistic effect against one VIM-1 producer (FICI=0.31) and an
      additivite effect (FICI=1) against one OXA-48 producer. In the time-kill
      assay, COL+AK, COL+TGC, COL+MEM and AK+TGC showed good synergistic effects
      against the KPC-2-producing isolate D16. COL+MEM and COL+TGC combinations
      showed good effects against the NDM-1-producing isolate L13 and
      IMP-4-producing isolate L34. Against the carbapenemase-non-producing
      isolate Y105, MEM+TGC and COL+AK showed high synergistic effects, with
      log(10)CFU/mL decreases of 6.2 and 5.5 compared to the most active single
      drug. In the G. mellonella survival assay, MEM-based combinations had
      relatively high survival rates, especially when combined with colistin,
      against KPC-2 producers (90% survival rate) and with amikacin against
      metallo-beta-lactamase producers (95-100% survival rate). CONCLUSION: Our
      study suggests that different antimicrobial agent combinations should be
      considered against CRKp infections with different resistance mechanisms.

AB  - KPC-53 enzyme is a natural KPC variant which showed a duplication of
      L167E168 residues in the Ω-loop structure. The bla(KPC-53) gene was cloned
      both into pBC-SK and pET-24a vectors, and the recombinant plasmids were
      transferred by transformation in Escherichia coli competent cells to
      evaluate the antimicrobial susceptibility and to produce the enzyme.
      Compared to KPC-3, the KPC-53 was less stable and showed a dramatic
      reduction of k(cat) and k(cat)/K(m) versus several β-lactams, in
      particular carbapenems. Indeed, a 2,000-fold reduction was observed in the
      k(cat) values of KPC-53 for imipenem and meropenem. Concerning inhibitors,
      KPC-53 was susceptible to tazobactam and clavulanic acid but maintained
      resistance to avibactam. The molecular modeling indicates that the
      L167E168 duplication in KPC-53 modifies the interactions between residues
      involved in the catalytic pocket, changing the flexibility of the Ω-loop,
      which is directly coupled with the catalytic properties of the KPC
      enzymes.

AB  - Bloodstream infection (BSI) caused by carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella
      pneumoniae (CRKP) is a serious and urgent threat for hospitalized
      patients. This study aims to describe the clinical and molecular
      characteristics of CRKP causing BSI in a tertiary-care hospital in
      Beijing, China. A total of 146 CRKP strains and 39 carbapenem-susceptible
      K. pneumoniae (CSKP) strains collected in the hospital from 2017 to 2020
      were sent for whole-genome sequencing. Univariate and multivariate
      analyses were used to evaluate risk factors for in-hospital mortality of
      CRKP-BSI cases. Thirty (20.5%) of 146 CRKP-BSI patients and three (7.7%)
      of 39 CSKP-BSI patients died at discharge (χ(2) = 3.471, P = 0.062).
      Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that age and use of
      urinary catheters were independent risk factors for the death of CRKP-BSI.
      The 146 CRKP isolates belonged to 9 sequence types (STs) and 11 serotypes,
      while the 39 CSKP isolates belonged to 23 STs and 27 serotypes. The
      mechanism of carbapenem resistance for all the CRKP strains was the
      acquisition of carbapenemase, mainly KPC-2 (n = 127). There were 2
      predominant serotypes for ST11 CRKP, namely, KL47 (n = 82) and KL64 (n =
      42). Some virulent genes, including rmpA2, iucABCD and iutA, and repB
      gene, which was involved in plasmid replication, were detected in all
      ST11-KL64 strains. Evolutionary transmission analysis suggested that ST11
      CRKP strains might have evolved from KL47 into KL64 and were accompanied
      by multiple outbreak events. This study poses an urgent need for enhancing
      infection control measures in the hospital, especially in the intensive
      care unit where the patients are at high-risk for acquiring CRKP-BSI.
      IMPORTANCE CRKP-BSI is demonstrated to cause high mortality. In this
      study, we demonstrated that ST11 CRKP strains might carry many virulent
      genes. Meanwhile, outbreak events occurred several times in the strains
      collected. Carbapenemase acquisition (mainly KPC-2 carbapenemase) was
      responsible for carbapenem resistance of all the 146 CRKP strains. As 2
      predominant strains, all ST11-KL64 strains, but not ST11-KL47 strains,
      carried rmpA2, iucABCD, iutA, as well as a plasmid replication initiator
      (repB). Our study suggested that the occurrence of region-specific
      recombination events manifested by the acquisition of some virulence genes
      might contribute to serotype switching from ST11-KL47 to ST11-KL64. The
      accumulation of virulent genes in epidemic resistant strains poses a great
      challenge for the prevention and treatment of BSI caused by K. pneumoniae
      in high-risk patients.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Recently, a marked increase in the rate of colistin
      resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae was observed in Croatian hospitals and the
      outpatient setting. This prompted us to analyze the molecular epidemiology
      of these isolates and the mechanisms of spread. METHODS: In total 46
      colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates from five hospitals and the
      community were analyzed. The presence of genes encoding broad and
      extended-spectrum β-lactamases, plasmid-mediated AmpC β-lactamases and
      carbapenemases was determined by PCR. Plasmids were characterized by PCR
      based replicon typing. Isolates were genotyped by pulsed-field gel
      electrophoresis. Virulence traits such as hemolysins, hyperviscosity and
      resistance to serum bactericidal activity were determined by phenotypic
      methods. RESULTS: High resistance rates were observed for cefuroxime,
      ceftazidime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone and ertapenem, ciprofloxacin and
      gentamicin. The majority of OXA-48 producing isolates were resistant to
      ertapenem but susceptible to imipenem and meropenem. Nine strains
      transferred ertapenem resistance to E. coli recipient strain. Thirty-nine
      strains were phenotypically positive for ESBLs and harbored group 1 of
      CTX-M β-lactamases. OXA-48 was detected in 39 isolates, KPC-2 in four and
      NDM-1 in one isolate. The isolates belonged to six PFGE clusters. All
      isolates were found to be resistant to serum bactericidal activity and all
      except four strains positive for KPC, produced β-hemolysins. String test
      indicating hypermucosity was positive in only one KPC producing organism.
      CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated the ability of K. pneumoniae to
      accumulate different resistance and virulence determinants. We reported
      dissemination of colistin resistant K. pneumoniae in five hospitals,
      located in different geographic regions of Croatia and in the outpatients
      setting. mcr genes responsible for transferable colistin resistance were
      not found, indicating that resistance was probably due to chromosomal
      mutations.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae causes a diversity of infections in both healthcare
      and community settings. This pathogen is showing an increased ability to
      accumulate antimicrobial resistance and virulence genes, making it a
      public health concern. Here we describe the whole-genome sequence
      characteristics of an ST15 colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae isolate
      obtained from a blood culture of a 79-year-old female patient admitted to
      a university hospital in Brazil. Kp14U04 was resistant to most clinically
      useful antimicrobial agents, remaining susceptible only to aminoglycosides
      and fosfomycin. The colistin resistance in this isolate was due to a ~1.3
      kb deletion containing four genes, namely mgrB, yebO, yobH and the
      transcriptional regulator kdgR. The study isolate presented a variety of
      antimicrobial resistance genes, including the carbapenemase-encoding gene
      bla (KPC-2), the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-encoding gene bla
      (SHV-28) and the beta-lactamase-encoding gene bla (OXA-1). Additionally,
      Kp14U04 harboured a multiple stress resistance protein, efflux systems and
      regulators, heavy metal resistance and virulence genes, plasmids,
      prophage-related sequences and genomic islands. These features revealed
      the high potential of this isolate to resist antimicrobial therapy,
      survive in adverse environments, cause infections and overcome host
      defence mechanisms.

AB  - Molecular and genomic surveillance systems for bacterial pathogens
      currently rely on tracking clonally evolving lineages. By contrast,
      plasmids are usually excluded or analyzed with low-resolution techniques,
      despite being the primary vectors of antibiotic resistance genes across
      many key pathogens. Here, we used a combination of long- and short-read
      sequence data of Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates (n = 1,717) from a
      European survey to perform an integrated, continent-wide study of
      chromosomal and plasmid diversity. This revealed three contrasting modes
      of dissemination used by carbapenemase genes, which confer resistance to
      last-line carbapenems. First, bla(OXA-48-like) genes have spread primarily
      via the single epidemic pOXA-48-like plasmid, which emerged recently in
      clinical settings and spread rapidly to numerous lineages. Second,
      bla(VIM) and bla(NDM) genes have spread via transient associations of many
      diverse plasmids with numerous lineages. Third, bla(KPC) genes have
      transmitted predominantly by stable association with one successful clonal
      lineage (ST258/512) yet have been mobilized among diverse plasmids within
      this lineage. We show that these plasmids, which include pKpQIL-like and
      IncX3 plasmids, have a long association (and are coevolving) with the
      lineage, although frequent recombination and rearrangement events between
      them have led to a complex array of mosaic plasmids carrying bla(KPC)
      Taken altogether, these results reveal the diverse trajectories of
      antibiotic resistance genes in clinical settings, summarized as using one
      plasmid/multiple lineages, multiple plasmids/multiple lineages, and
      multiple plasmids/one lineage. Our study provides a framework for the much
      needed incorporation of plasmid data into genomic surveillance systems, an
      essential step toward a more comprehensive understanding of resistance
      spread.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Infections caused by KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae
      (KPC-Kp) are not well represented in pivotal trials with
      ceftazidime-avibactam (CAZ-AVI). This study aimed to investigate its
      efficacy in a single-centre cohort of patients infected with KPC-Kp.
      METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted of consecutive
      patients treated for > 72 hours with CAZ-AVI for KPC-Kp infections.
      Fourteen-day clinical response was considered when none of these criteria
      were present: i) the patient died before day 14, ii) treatment with
      CAZ-AVI at day 14 for persistence of symptoms or signs of infection, iii)
      recurrence. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to identify
      factors predictive of 14-day clinical failure. A propensity score to
      receive targeted initial treatment with CAZ-AVI was used as a covariate of
      the analysis. RESULTS: Forty-seven patients were included. The median age
      was 70 years and the median Charlson index was 4. The most frequent
      sources of infection were intraabdominal (n = 18; 38.3%) followed by
      pneumonia (n = 14; 29.8%). Twenty-five patients (53.2%) had septic shock.
      CAZ-AVI was used as monotherapy in 34 (72.3%) of the cases. CAZ-AVI
      resistance was detected after CAZ-AVI therapy in six of 47 (12.7%)
      patients. Thirty-day crude mortality was 23.4% (n = 11). The 14-day
      clinical response rate was 59.6% (n = 28). Pneumonia (OR 7.57; 95% CI
      1.45-39.43; P = 0.01), and INCREMENT-CPE score > 7 points (OR 6.73; 95% CI
      1.39-34.94; P = 0.02) were associated with 14-day clinical failure.
      CONCLUSIONS: CAZ-AVI offers an advance for the treatment of KPC-Kp
      infections. In patients with pneumonia or an INCREMENT-CPE score > 7
      points it may be reasonable to use CAZ-AVI in combination.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Klebsiella pneumoniae is a common multidrug-resistant pathogen
      that jeopardizes the health of hospitalized patients. We aimed to study
      the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of carbapenem-resistant K.
      pneumoniae (CRKP) isolates from a hospital in Beijing. METHODS:
      Twenty-four CRKP clinical isolates were collected within a half-year to
      investigate antimicrobial resistance and genomic characteristics. Illumina
      and Nanopore sequencing were performed to assemble and annotate genomes.
      RESULTS: All strains were multi-drug resistant. Twenty-two strains carried
      the bla (KPC-2) gene and two harbored bla (NDM-5). Multilocus sequence
      type(MLST) analysis identified five sequence types; most isolates belonged
      to ST11. Three strains were isolated from the same patient; each carried a
      different plasmid replicon, either IncFII ((pHN7A8)), IncX, or IncFIB
      ((K)). CONCLUSION: This study furthers the understanding of CRKP
      antimicrobial resistance genotypes, and may facilitate the control of
      nosocomial infections caused by antimicrobial-resistant pathogens.

AB  - The emergence of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) nosocomial
      outbreaks related to specific bla(KPC) gene variants dictates the need for
      applicable diagnostic methods for allele discrimination. We report here a
      simple method of bla(KPC-9) allele recognition based on a combination of
      endonuclease digestion analysis and PCR amplification using unique
      primers. K. pneumoniae isolates carrying the bla(KPC) gene were tested.
      Digestion with RsaI restriction endonuclease was found to efficiently
      differentiate the bla(KPC-2) from the bla(KPC-9) variants into two
      distinct groups of digestion patterns named KPC-2-like and KPC-9-like,
      respectively. An additional procedure, the amplification refractory
      mutation system (ARMS) method, was applied to identify the variant within
      the same group. The principles of this procedure could be developed to
      identify several bla(KPC) gene variants, as well as monitoring the spread
      and evolution of specific KPC variants within local geographical regions.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Active screening is a crucial element for the prevention of
      carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) transmission in
      healthcare settings. Here we propose a culture-based protocol for rectal
      swab CPE screening that combines CPE detection with identification of the
      carbapenemase type. METHODS: The workflow integrates an automatic digital
      analysis of selective chromogenic media (WASPLab®; Copan), with subsequent
      rapid tests for the confirmation of carbapenemase production [i.e.
      detection of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-specific peak by
      matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionisation time-of-flight mass
      spectrometry (MALDI-TOF/MS) or a multiplex immunochromatographic assay
      identifying the five commonest carbapenemase types]. To evaluate the
      performance of this protocol in depth, data for 21 162 rectal swabs
      submitted for CPE screening to the Microbiology Unit of S. Orsola-Malpighi
      Hospital (Bologna, Italy) were analysed. RESULTS: Considering its ability
      to correctly segregate plates with/without Enterobacteriaceae, WASPLab
      Image Analysis Software showed globally a sensitivity and specificity of
      100% and 79.4%, respectively. Of the plates with bacterial growth (n =
      901), 693 (76.9%) were found to be positive for CPE by MALDI-TOF/MS
      (KPC-specific peak for K. pneumoniae) or by immunochromatographic assay.
      Only 2.8% (16/570) of KPC-positive K. pneumoniae strains were missed by
      the specific MALDI-TOF/MS algorithm, being detected by the
      immunochromatographic assay. The mean turnaround time needed from sample
      arrival to the final report ranged between 18 and 24 h, representing a
      significant time saving compared with manual reading. CONCLUSION: This
      workflow proved to be fast and reliable, being particularly suitable for
      areas endemic for KPC-producing K. pneumoniae and for high-throughput
      laboratories.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Ceftazidime-avibactam (CAZ-AVI) is a promising novel agent
      with activity against carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae. Here, we
      describe the dynamic evolution of a Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) infection in a
      critically ill patient treated with CAZ-AVI-tigecycline combination
      therapy. METHODS: Whole-genome sequencing was performed on longitudinal
      intrapatient KPC-Kp strains isolated from different sites during CAZ-AVI
      treatment. The pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) analysis was
      performed on the basis of therapeutic drug monitoring of ceftazidime.
      RESULTS: The development of resistance due to mutations in the blaKPC gene
      was observed in KPC-Kp strains isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage and
      blood during CAZ-AVI treatment. PK/PD analysis demonstrated that during
      the first days of treatment CAZ- AVI blood exposure was suboptimal
      (steady-state concentration/minimum inhibitory concentration ratio 2.85).
      Of note, the low antibiotic pressure may have selected hybrid
      subpopulations harboring bla(KPC-3) and T243M mutation in KPC-Kp isolated
      from bronchoalveolar lavage and D179Y mutation in those isolated from
      blood. CONCLUSION: These results suggest the high adaptability of KPC to
      CAZ-AVI due to the rapid evolution of resistance and highlight the
      importance of identifying the optimal PK/PD target to prevent such an
      event from occurring again in a critically ill patient with pneumonia due
      to KPC-Kp.

      human-simulated plasma and ELF exposures against
      serine-carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in the neutropenic
      murine pneumonia model. METHODS: Ten clinical isolates were utilized:
      eight were serine-carbapenemase-producing (KPC, n = 4; OXA-48-like, n = 4)
      Enterobacterales with WCK 5222 MICs (1:1) ranging from 1 to 4 mg/L; and
      two were previously studied MDR isolates serving as quality controls.
      Lungs of mice were inoculated with 50 μL of 107 cfu/mL. Treatment mice
      received human-simulated regimens of cefepime, zidebactam or WCK 5222
      derived from plasma or epithelial lining fluid (ELF) profiles obtained
      from healthy subjects. Lung bacterial densities resulting from the
      humanized exposures in plasma and ELF were compared. RESULTS: Initial lung
      bacterial densities ranged from 6.06 to 6.87 log10 cfu/lungs, with a mean
      bacterial burden increase to 9.06 ± 0.42 after 24 h. Human-simulated
      plasma and ELF exposures of cefepime and zidebactam monotherapy had no
      activity. Human-simulated WCK 5222 plasma exposures resulted in a >1 log10
      cfu/lungs reduction in bacterial burden for all isolates. Humanized WCK
      5222 ELF exposures achieved a >1 log10 cfu/lungs reduction for all
      isolates. While statistically significant differences in bacterial burden
      reduction were observed between the plasma and ELF exposures for WCK 5222
      in 5/8 isolates, all treatments achieved the translational kill target of
      a >1 log10 cfu reduction. CONCLUSIONS: Clinically achievable WCK 5222
      plasma and ELF exposures produced in vivo killing of carbapenem-resistant
      Enterobacterales in the neutropenic murine pneumonia model that is
      predictive of efficacy in humans.

AB  - Vaborbactam is a novel boron-based beta-lactamase inhibitor developed to
      be effective against Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing
      bacteria. This enzyme is a key driver in the global spread of β-lactam
      resistance among carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales. Alone, vaborbactam
      has no antibacterial activity; however, the combination of
      meropenem-vaborbactam has enhanced activity against gram-negative
      organisms, particularly Enterobacterales with class A and C
      carbapenemases. Multiple in vitro studies evaluating isolates from various
      geographic regions, and over different time periods, have demonstrated the
      high potency of meropenem-vaborbactam against organisms containing KPC2
      and KPC3. However, meropenem-vaborbactam does not have activity against
      OXA-48 or metallo-beta lactamases. This review covers the in vitro studies
      of meropenem-vaborbactam performed to date, which evaluated both large
      cohorts of clinical isolates and engineered isolates, to determine
      efficacy in various settings, including the presence of porin mutations

AB  - BACKGROUND: The phenomenon of co-infection with multiple
      carbapenem-resistant bacteria is growing, which pose a great challenge for
      infection control and treatment. This study aimed to analyze predictors of
      occurrence and 30-day mortality for carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella
      pneumoniae and carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii co-infection.
      METHODS: From June 2018 to June 2021, clinical data of 103 patients
      co-infected with carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) and
      carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) were collected from a
      tertiary teaching hospital in Anhui Province, China. The clinical
      characteristics and predictors of mortality were analyzed. Meanwhile, the
      bacterial isolates were characterized for drug susceptibility, multi-locus
      sequence typing, and drug resistance genes. RESULTS: The multivariate
      analysis revealed that fiberoptic bronchoscopy (p = 0.005, OR=2.72),
      repeat transfusions (p = 0.008, OR= 2.23) and exposure to tigecycline (p =
      0.002, OR = 6.58) were independent risk factors for CRKP and CRAB
      co-infection. Neutrophil ≥11.9*10(9) (p = 0.035, adjusted HR = 3.12) and
      C-reactive protein ≥ 149 mg/L (p = 0.009, adjusted HR = 4.41) were found
      associated with 30-day mortality. Combined neutrophil with C-reactive
      protein could predict 30-day mortality, of which AUC value was 0.791
      (95%CI: 0.661-0.921). KPC (46/51, 90.2%) was the most common carbapenemase
      in CRKP. 33 isolates of CRKP belong to ST11 (33/51, 64.7%), and three new
      ST types ST5882, ST5883, ST5885 were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Invasive
      operations and antibiotics exposure can lead to CRKP and CRAB
      co-infection. Combined neutrophil with C-reactive protein could predict
      30-day mortality.

AB  - Surveillance of carbapenem resistance is particularly important for
      Enterobacterales, mainly in countries with limited healthcare resources.
      We conducted a cross-sectional study to detect carbapenem-resistant
      Enterobacterales at 10 sentinel hospitals in Havana, Cuba for a six
      year-period (2016-2021) by the National Reference Laboratory for Health
      Care-Associated Infections in the Pedro Kourí Institute. A total of 152
      isolates were collected with phenotypic production of metallo-β-lactamase.
      NDM-type carbapenemase was detected in all the 152 isolates, and KPC-type
      enzyme gene was simultaneously identified in four NDM-positive isolates.
      The most abundant carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) species
      was Klebsiella pneumoniae (69.7%), followed by Enterobacter cloacae
      complex (13.2%), and Escherichia coli (5.9%). Over the study period, among
      CPE, prevalence of K. pneumoniae was almost constant, while Enterobacter
      spp. showed slightly increasing tendency. The urinary tract (36.2%) was
      the most prevalent source of infection with CPE, followed by bloodstream
      (26.3%) and surgical wound (17.1%), being frequently derived from
      Intensive Care Units (35.5%) and urology wards (21.7%). This study
      revealed the present situation of CPE in hospitals in Havana, Cuba,
      showing the emergence and dissemination of Enterobacterales producing
      NDM-type carbapenemase, mainly K. pneumoniae.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Optimal combination therapy for Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) is unknown. The
      present study sought to characterize the pharmacodynamics (PD) of
      polymyxin B (PMB), meropenem (MEM) and rifampin (RIF) alone and in
      combination using a hollow fibre infection model (HFIM) coupled with
      mechanism-based modelling (MBM). METHODS: A 10-day HFIM was utilized to
      simulate human pharmacokinetics (PK) of various PMB, MEM and RIF dosing
      regimens against a clinical KPC-Kp isolate, with total and resistant
      subpopulations quantified to capture PD response. A MBM was developed to
      characterize bacterial subpopulations and synergy between agents.
      Simulations using the MBM and published population PK models were employed
      to forecast the bacterial time course and the extent of its variability in
      infected patients for three-drug regimens. RESULTS: In the HFIM, a PMB
      single-dose ('burst') regimen of 5.53 mg/kg combined with MEM 8 g using a
      3-hr prolonged infusion every 8 hr and RIF 600 mg every 24 hr resulted in
      bacterial counts below the quantitative limit within 24 hr and remained
      undetectable throughout the 10-day experiment. The final MBM consisted of
      two bacterial subpopulations of differing PMB and MEM joint susceptibility
      and the ability to form a non-replicating, tolerant subpopulation.
      Synergistic interactions between PMB, MEM and RIF were well quantified,
      with the MBM providing adequate capture of the observed data. DISCUSSION:
      An in vitro-in silico approach answers questions related to PD
      optimization as well as overall feasibility of combination therapy against
      KPC-Kp, offering crucial insights in the absence of clinical trials.

AB  - Carbapenem resistance among Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates is often
      related to carbapenemase genes, located in genetic transmissible elements,
      particularly the bla(KPC) gene, which variants are spread in several
      countries. Recently, reports of K. pneumoniae isolates harboring the
      bla(NDM) gene have increased dramatically along with the dissemination of
      epidemic high-risk clones (HRCs). In the present study, we report the
      multiclonal spread of New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM)-producing K.
      pneumoniae in different healthcare institutions in the state of Pará,
      Northern Brazil. A total of 23 NDM-producing isolates were tested
      regarding antimicrobial susceptibility testing features, screening of
      carbapenemase genes, and genotyping by multilocus sequencing typing
      (MLST). All K. pneumoniae isolates were determined as multidrug-resistant
      (MDR), being mainly resistant to carbapenems, cephalosporins, and
      fluoroquinolones. The bla(NDM-7) (60.9%-14/23) and bla(NDM-1) (34.8%-8/23)
      variants were detected. MLST genotyping revealed the predomination of
      HRCs, including ST11/CC258, ST340/CC258, ST15/CC15, ST392/CC147, among
      others. To conclude, the present study reveals the contribution of HRCs
      and non-HRCs in the spread of NDM-1 and NDM-7-producing K. pneumoniae
      isolates in Northern (Amazon region) Brazil, along with the first
      detection of NDM-7 variant in Latin America and Brazil, highlighting the
      need for surveillance and control of strains that may negatively impact
      healthcare and antimicrobial resistance.

AB  - This study reports on the characterization of two ceftazidime-avibactam
      (CZA)-resistant KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae strains (KP-14159 and
      KP-8788) sequentially isolated from infections occurred in a patient never
      treated with CZA. Whole-genome sequencing characterization using a
      combined short- and long-read sequencing approach showed that both
      isolates belonged to the same ST258 strain, had altered outer membrane
      porins (a truncated OmpK35 and an Asp137Thr138 duplication in the L3 loop
      of OmpK36), and carried novel pKpQIL plasmid derivatives (pIT-14159 and
      pIT-8788, respectively) harboring two copies of the Tn4401a KPC-3-encoding
      transposon. Plasmid pIT-8788 was a cointegrate of pIT-14159 with a ColE
      replicon (that was also present in KP-14159) apparently evolved in vivo
      during infection. pIT-8788 was maintained at a higher copy number than
      pIT-14159 and, upon transfer to Escherichia coli DH10B, was able to
      increase the CZA MIC by 32-fold. The present findings provide novel
      insights about the mechanisms of acquired resistance to CZA, underscoring
      the role that the evolution of broadly disseminated pKpQIL plasmid
      derivatives may have in increasing the bla(KPC) gene copy number and KPC-3
      expression in bacterial hosts. Although not self-transferable, similar
      elements, with multiple copies of Tn4401 and maintained at a high copy
      number, could mediate transferable CZA resistance upon mobilization.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The global epidemic of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella
      pneumonia (CRKP) has become a significant public health challenge. This
      study aimed to investigate the antibiotic resistance and molecular
      characteristics of CRKP and the clinical characteristics of infected
      patients. METHODS: Sixty-two clinically isolated CRKP strains were
      collected for the first time from the First Affiliated Hospital of
      Zhejiang Chinese Medical University in Zhejiang Province. The
      carbapenemase gene, virulence-associated gene, capsular serotype gene and
      fenestra protein gene were detected by PCR. Univariate logistic regression
      and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to predict
      the risk factors for the prognosis of CRKP infection. RESULTS: All CRKP
      isolates were resistant to meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, and
      ceftazidime (100%, 62/62), and all but one CRKP isolate was resistant to
      imipenem and cefepime (96.8%, 61/62). The rate of colistin resistance was
      the lowest (11.9%, 8/62). For CRKP in the ICU, the rates of resistance to
      various antibiotics were significantly higher than those in general ward
      patients. Fifty strains carried the carbapenemase gene bla (KPC), and 3
      strains carried both the bla (KPC) and bla (NDM) genes. The virulence
      genes uge, wabG, ycf, entB, ureA and fimH were detected in more than 90%
      of the 62 CRKP strains. Two strains had Ompk35, Ompk36 and Hcp gene
      deletions. The bla (KPC), rmpA and rmpA2 genes had the highest positive
      rate in blood samples, and bla (NDM) had the highest positive rate in
      stool samples. Multivariate analysis showed that pulmonary disease
      affected the prognosis of CRKP infection. CONCLUSION: The prevalence and
      molecular characteristics of CRKP clinical isolates in Zhengjiang Province
      in China were described, and the antibiotic resistance rate was higher.
      Additionally, relevant genes of CRKP strains and clinical characteristics
      of patients are related to the progression and prognosis of CRKP
      infection.

AB  - Phage therapy is now reconsidered with interest in the treatment of
      bacterial infections. A major piece of information for this application is
      the definition of the molecular targets exploited by phages to infect
      bacteria. Here, the genetic basis of resistance to the lytic phage φBO1E
      by its susceptible host Klebsiella pneumoniae KKBO-1 has been
      investigated. KKBO-1 phage-resistant mutants were obtained by infection at
      high multiplicity. One mutant, designated BO-FR-1, was selected for
      subsequent experiments, including virulence assessment in a Galleria
      mellonella infection model and characterization by whole-genome
      sequencing. Infection with BO-FR-1 was associated with a significantly
      lower mortality when compared to that of the parental strain. The BO-FR-1
      genome differed from KKBO-1 by a single nonsense mutation into the wbaP
      gene, which encodes a glycosyltransferase involved in the first step of
      the biosynthesis of the capsular polysaccharide (CPS). Phage
      susceptibility was restored when BO-FR-1 was complemented with the
      constitutive wbaP gene. Our results demonstrated that φBO1E infects KKBO-1
      targeting the bacterial CPS. Interestingly, BO-FR-1 was less virulent than
      the parental strain, suggesting that in the context of the interplay among
      phage, bacterial pathogen and host, the emergence of phage resistance may
      be beneficial for the host.

AB  - Infections caused by KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp-KPC) are
      associated with high mortality rates due to the increased number of
      resistant isolates and the scarcity of therapeutic options. This scenario
      reinforces the urgent need for new chemotherapeutics. Herein, we
      investigated the effects of 1,10-phenanthroline-5,6-dione (phendione) and
      its metal-based complexes, [Cu(phendione)(3) ](ClO(4) )(2) .4H(2) O
      (Cu-phendione) and [Ag(phendione)(2) ]ClO(4) (Ag-phendione), both alone
      and also combined with carbapenems (meropenem (MEM), and imipenem),
      against 46 clonally distinct clinical strains of Kp-KPC. All isolates were
      found to be multidrug resistant in accordance with their susceptibility
      patterns by disk diffusion method. Compounds geometric mean (GM)-MIC and
      GM-MBC values (μmol l(-1) ), respectively, were: phendione, 42·06 and
      71·27; Cu-phendione, 9·88 and 13·75; and Ag-phendione, 10·10 and 13·06.
      Higher synergism rates of MEM-containing combinations were observed by the
      checkerboard assay, particularly with the two metal complexes. Moreover,
      drug combinations were able to re-sensitize 87% of the phenotypically
      non-susceptible strains. Time-kill studies, with MEM plus Cu-phendione or
      Ag-phendione, indicated that combinations with 0·5× MIC of each agent
      produce synergistic effects after 9-12 h. The MEM plus Ag-phendione
      eradicated about 10(6) CFU per ml of bacteria. These findings support the
      effectiveness of the re-sensitizing combinatorial approach and provide
      evidence that phendione-based compounds offer real promise in the fight
      against Kp-KPC infections.

AB  - Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) are a growing public health
      concern due to resistance to multiple antibiotics and potential to cause
      health care-associated infections with high mortality.
      Carbapenemase-producing CRE are of particular concern given that
      carbapenemase-encoding genes often are located on mobile genetic elements
      that may spread between different organisms and species. In this study, we
      performed phenotypic and genotypic characterization of CRE collected at
      eight U.S. sites participating in active population- and laboratory-based
      surveillance of carbapenem-resistant organisms. Among 421 CRE tested, the
      majority were isolated from urine (n = 349, 83%). Klebsiella pneumoniae
      was the most common organism (n = 265, 63%), followed by Enterobacter
      cloacae complex (n = 77, 18%) and Escherichia coli (n = 50, 12%). Of 419
      isolates analyzed by whole genome sequencing, 307 (73%) harbored a
      carbapenemase gene; variants of bla(KPC) predominated (n = 299, 97%). The
      occurrence of carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae complex,
      and E. coli varied by region; the predominant sequence type within each
      genus was ST258, ST171, and ST131, respectively. None of the
      carbapenemase-producing CRE isolates displayed resistance to all
      antimicrobials tested; susceptibility to amikacin and tigecycline was
      generally retained.

AB  - Aim: The aim of this study was to identify antimicrobial resistance genes,
      virulence factor genes, and porin loss or mutations exhibited by the
      multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strain. Materials and Methods:
      Whole-genome sequencing was done via the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform.
      Strain identification and antibiotic susceptibility testing of strains
      were performed by the Vitek 2 automated system. Multilocus sequence typing
      analysis was carried out using seven conserved housekeeping genes.
      Results: The strain was resistant to penicillins, cephalosporins,
      carbapenems, aminoglycosides, fluoroquinolones, fosfomycin, and
      trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. The isolate was found to carry KPC-3,
      CTX-M-27, SHV-11, SHV-67, and TEM-1 β-lactamases. The clonal subtype of
      the isolate was ST147, and it possessed wzi64 and wzc38 alleles. Fifteen
      different point mutations (N49S, L59V, R146H, V178P, G189T, F198Y, V202L,
      F207Y, A217S, T222L, D223G, H235N, A280V, N304E, and S346N) were detected
      in the OmpK36 porin. A frame shift was observed in OmpK35 and two
      different point mutations (I70M and I128M) were found in the OmpK37 porin,
      in addition to seven mutations observed on the AcrR. Conclusions: This
      study demonstrated for the first time that the ST147 clone produced
      CTX-M-27 as well as KPC-3. In addition, new mutations were detected in the
      outer membrane proteins. These mutations together with the production of
      extended-spectrum β-lactamase and carbapenemase were found to contribute
      to the resistance of the ST147 clone to carbapenem and other antibiotics.

AB  - PURPOSE: We aimed to develop a new procedure for rapid detection of the
      carbapenemase activity using MALDI-TOF MS, and to determine the
      sensitivity and specificity of the method. Also, we aimed to determine the
      distribution of carbapenemase genes among the K.pneumoniae strains
      isolated in our hospital using real-time PCR. METHOD: Between January
      2017-February 2019; K. pneumoniae strains(n = 74) isolated from blood
      culture samples were included. Klebsiella pneumoniae NCTC 13438 was used
      as a positive control and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922 as a negative
      control. First, Imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem MIC values of strains
      were determined. Then bla(KPC), bla(OXA-48,) and/or bla(NDM) genes were
      investigated with PCR. Carbapenemase activity was investigated in strains
      with the newly developed method using MALDI-TOF MS. The performance of the
      new method was evaluated for both the second and fourth hours of the
      incubation period. RESULTS: While 65 strains were found resistant to
      tested carbapenems, nine of them were susceptible. Of the 65 resistant
      strains, 57 had bla(OXA-48), 15 had bla(NDM), and four had bla(KPC) genes.
      Bla(OXA-48) and bla(NDM) genes were detected together in 11 strains.
      Bla(OXA-48), bla(NDM,) and bla(KPC) genes were not detected in any of the
      susceptible strains. The sensitivity and specificity of MALDI-TOF MS at
      the second hour were 83.1% and 100%, respectively. At the fourth hour, the
      sensitivity and specificity of MALDI-TOF MS were 100%. No false-positive
      results were observed. CONCLUSION: The sensitivity of the method at the
      fourth hour was better than the second hour. The false-negative results
      observed in the second hour disappeared when the incubation period was
      extended to 4 h. MALDI-TOF MS which is still under development is a fast,
      cost-effective, promising method for the detection of carbapenemase
      activity.

AB  - Misuse of antibiotics in the clinical and agricultural sectors has caused
      the emergence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Klebsiella pneumoniae which
      contributes a threat to human health. In this study, we assessed the
      feasibility of lavender essential oil (LVO) as an antimicrobial agent in
      combinatory therapy with meropenem in suppressing the growth of
      carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae (KPC-KP). Synergistic interactions
      between LVO and meropenem were detected, which significantly reduce the
      inhibitory concentration of both LVO and meropenem by 15 and 4-fold
      respectively. Comparative proteomic profiling identified a disruption in
      the bacterial membrane via oxidative stress that was indicated by loss of
      membrane and cytoplasmic proteins and the upregulation of oxidative
      regulators. As a proof of concept, zeta potential measurements showed a
      change in cell surface charge while outer membrane permeability
      measurement indicated an increase in membrane permeability following
      exposure to LVO. This was indicative of a disrupted outer membrane.
      Ethidium bromide influx/efflux assays demonstrated no significant efflux
      pump inhibition by LVO, and scanning electron microscopy revealed
      irregularities on the cell surface after exposure to LVO. Oxidative stress
      was also detected with increased level of ROS and lipid peroxidation in
      LVO-treated cells. In conclusion, our data suggest that LVO induced
      oxidative stress in K. pneumoniae which oxidizes the outer membrane,
      enabling the influx of generated ROS, LVO and meropenem into the bacterial
      cells, causing damage to the cells and eventually death.

AB  - To investigate the carbapenemases distribution of carbapenem-resistant
      Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) in the intensive care unit, and the clinical
      characteristics between carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent Klebsiella
      pneumoniae (CR-hvKP) and carbapenem-resistant non-hypervirulent Klebsiella
      pneumoniae (CR-non-hvKP) were compared. A total of 53 non-repetitive CRKP
      strains isolated from 49 patients in the intensive care unit of the Second
      Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong University from May 2020 to March
      2021 were retrospectively studied. The carbapenemase inhibitor enhancement
      test was used for screening carbapenemase-producing strains, and the
      string test was carried out to screen the hypermucoviscosity phenotype.
      Using PCR to detect five main carbapenemase genes (bla(KPC-2), bla(NDM),
      bla(IMP) , bla(VIM) and bla(OXA-48-like)), common serotype (K1 and K2) and
      virulence gene (rmpA and iutA). Treated the strains with both rmpA and
      iutA genes as hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumonia (hvKP), and the whole
      genome sequencing of CR-hvKP was completed. At the same time, the clinical
      data of 49 patients were sorted out, and the differences in clinical
      characteristics of CR-hvKP and CR-non-hvKP infected patients were compared
      using the independent sample t test, Mann-Whitney U test, chi-square test
      or Fisher's exact probability test. CRKP isolated from the intensive care
      unit were extensively drug resistance and still had a good sensitivity to
      polymyxin B and tigecycline. Producing carbapenemases were the main
      resistance mechanism of CRKP (52/53, 98.1%). Of the 53 CRKP strains,
      except for 1strain that did not detect carbapenemase, at least one
      carbapenemase resistance gene was detected in the remaining 52 CRKP
      strains, of which 45 strains carried an enzyme, including 36 bla(KPC-2)
      (36/53, 67.9%), 8 bla(NDM) (8/53, 15.1%), 1 bla(IMP) (1/53, 1.9%), and 7
      strains carried with both bla(KPC-2) and bla(NDM) (7/53, 13.2%). String
      test and virulence gene showed that 7 CR-hvKP strains (13.2%) were
      detected in 53 CRKP strains, and two of which were hypermucoviscosity
      phenotype. Sequencing results revealed that CR-hvKP were mainly ST11 type.
      Almost all patients with CR-hvKP infection were over 60 years old (7/7),
      with invasive treatment (7/7), pulmonary infection with hypermucoviscosity
      phenotype (2/7) and high mortality (5/7); and the percentage of
      neutrophils in patients with CR-hvKP infection (86.44±4.70) % was higher
      than those patients with CR-non-hvKP infection (78.90±19.15) %, the
      difference was statistically significant (t=-2.225, P=0.032). The CR-hvKP
      strains in the intensive care unit mainly produced KPC-2 enzyme, with K2
      capsular serotype and ST11 type. It is necessary to strengthen the
      monitoring and control of the CR-hvKP strain to prevent the co-evolution
      of drug-resistant and hypervirulent strains.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The hospital environment can be an important source for the
      transmission of pathogens, However, there are rare reports revealing the
      contamination of carbapenemase-producing enterobacterales (CPE) in the
      hospital environment. The aim of this study was to investigate the
      presence of CPE in hospital environments and their relation to clinical
      strains. METHODS: Environmental samples were collected from three tertiary
      university hospitals between June 2017 and August 2019. The environmental
      samples were inoculated on CHROMagar™ KPC plates. A multiplex PCR and
      sequencing were used for six carbapenemase genes. Multi-locus sequence
      typing (MLST) was performed for CPE of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia
      coli, and Enterobacter cloacae complex from the environmental and clinical
      specimens. RESULTS: 20 carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE)
      strains were detected in the beds of patients, toilet bowl, sink,
      patient's gown, electromanometer, and keyboard. K. pneumoniae was the most
      common, followed by Serratia marcescens, E. cloacae complex, E. coli, and
      Citrobacter freundii. Nineteen CRE were CPE. Eighteen of 19 CPEs produced
      KPC-2 carbapenemase, and one CPE (E. coli) produced NDM-5. We confirmed
      that the STs of K. pneumoniae-producing KPC-2 (ST 307 and ST11) and E.
      coli producing KPC-2 (ST648) from hospital environment were the same as
      those from patients. CONCLUSION: We believe that the hospital environment
      can be an important route for CPE transmission. Therefore, continuous
      surveillance and management are needed to prevent hospital-acquired
      infections (HAI) by transmission of CPE.

AB  - K. pneumoniae isolates often harbor various antibiotic resistance
      determinants including extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs),
      plasmid-mediated AmpC β-lactamases (p-Amp-C) and carbapenemases. In this
      study we analyzed 65 K. pneumoniae isolates obtained from urinary tract
      infections in the outpatients setting, with regard to antibiotic
      susceptibility, β-lactamase production, virulence traits and plasmid
      content.Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by broth microdilution
      method. PCR was applied to detect genes encoding ESBLs, p-Amp-C and
      carbapenemases and plasmid incompatibility groups. Phenotypic methods were
      applied to characterize virulence determinants. Increasing resistance
      trend was observed for amoxicillin/clavulanate, imipenem, meropenem and
      ciprofloxacin. The study showed that ESBLs belonging to the CTX-M family,
      conferring high level of resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins
      (ESC) were the dominant resistance trait among early isolates (2013 to
      2016) whereas OXA-48 carbapenemase, belonging to class D, emerged in
      significant numbers after 2017. OXA-48 producing organisms coharbored
      ESBLs. KPC-2 was dominant among isolates from Dubrovnik in the recent
      years. Colistin resistance was reported in three isolates. Inc L/M was the
      dominant plasmid in the later period, encoding OXA-48. Hyperviscosity was
      linked to KPC positivity and emerged in the later period. This report
      describes evolution of antibiotic resistance in K. pneumoniae from ESBLs
      to carbapenemases and colistin resistance. The study demonstrated the
      ability of K. pneumoniae to acquire various resistance determinants, over
      time. The striking diversity of the UTI isolates could result from
      introduction of the isolates from the hospitals, transfer of plasmids and
      multidirectional evolution.

AB  - Mounting antimicrobial resistance to carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella
      pneumoniae (CPKP) highlights the need to optimize currently available
      treatment options. The objective of this study was to explore alternative
      dosing strategies that limit the emergence of resistance to preserve the
      utility of last-line antibiotics by: (i) evaluating the pharmacodynamic
      (PD) killing activity of simulated humanized exposures to monotherapy and
      two-drug and three-drug combinations against CPKP bacterial isolates with
      different resistance mechanisms; and (ii) optimizing polymyxin B (PMB)
      exposure simulated in the three-drug combination regimens to maximize the
      killing activity. Two CPKP clinical isolates (BAA2146 (NDM-1) and BRKP76
      (KPC-2)) were evaluated over 168 hours using a hollow-fiber infection
      model simulating clinically relevant PMB, fosfomycin, and meropenem dosing
      regimens. PMB-based three-drug combinations were further optimized by
      varying the initial exposure (0-24 hours) or maintenance dose received
      over the duration of treatment. The area under the bacterial
      load-versus-time curve (AUCFU) was used to determine PD activity. Overall
      reductions in PMB exposure ranged from 2 to 84%. BAA2146 and BRKP76 had
      median (range) AUCFUs of 11.0 (10.6-11.6) log(10 ) CFU hour/mL and 7.08
      (7.04-11.9) log(10) CFU hour/mL, respectively. The PMB "front loaded" 2.5
      mg/kg/day + 0.5 mg/kg maintenance dose in combination with meropenem and
      fosfomycin was a promising regimen against BRKP76, with an overall
      reduction in PMB exposure of 56% while still eradicating the bacteria.
      Tailored triple-combination therapy allows for the optimization of dose
      and treatment duration of last-line agents like PMB to achieve adequate
      drug exposure and appropriate PD activity while minimizing the emergence
      of resistance.

      commonly encountered include Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC),
      New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM), and OXA-48, with OXA-48 thought to be
      endemic to North Africa. These enzymes are frequently found on mobile
      genetic elements and have the potential to be widespread over the world,
      while the situation in Algeria is not well documented. In this article, we
      provide an in-depth review of CPE in Algeria, providing up-to-date
      information on the subject.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The increasing prevalence of carbapenem-resistant
      Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) is a growing problem globally, particularly in
      low- to middle-income countries (LMICs). Previous studies have shown high
      rates of CRE colonisation among patients at hospitals in LMICs, with
      increased risk of hospital-acquired infections. METHODS: We isolated
      carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) from faecal samples
      collected in 2017 from patients at admission and discharge at a Vietnamese
      neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). 126 CRKP were whole-genome sequenced.
      The phylogenetic relationship between the isolates and between clinical
      CRKP isolates collected in 2012-2018 at the same hospital were
      investigated. RESULTS: NDM-type carbapenemase-(61%) and KPC-2-encoding
      genes (41%) were the most common carbapenem resistance genes observed
      among the admission and discharge isolates. Most isolates (56%) belonged
      to three distinct clonal clusters of ST15, carrying bla(KPC-2), bla(NDM-1)
      and bla(NDM-4), respectively. Each cluster also comprised clinical
      isolates from blood collected at the study hospital. The most dominant
      ST15 clone was shown to be related to isolates collected from the same
      hospital as far back as in 2012. CONCLUSIONS: Highly resistant CRKP were
      found colonising admission and discharge patients at a Vietnamese NICU,
      emphasising the importance of continued monitoring. Whole-genome
      sequencing revealed a population of CRKP consisting mostly of ST15
      isolates in three clonally related clusters, each related to blood
      isolates collected from the same hospital. Furthermore, clinical isolates
      collected from previous years (dating back to 2012) were shown to likely
      be clonally descended from ST15 isolates in the largest cluster,
      suggesting a successful hospital strain which can colonise inpatients.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: In China, OXA-48-producing Enterobacterales have been
      identified sporadically, causing small-scale regional outbreaks. This
      study investigated the molecular epidemiology, transmission and evolution
      of OXA-48-producing Enterobacterales and pOXA48 from mainland China.
      METHODS: We conducted a multicentre resistance monitoring project from
      2013-2018. Genome sequencing of OXA-48-produicng isolates was performed.
      SNPs were analysed. Eleven isolates were selected for subsequent SMRT
      sequencing. Genome sequences were annotated, and alignment of the complete
      sequences of bla(OXA-48)-carrying plasmids from a subset of isolates that
      underwent long-read sequencing was performed. RESULTS: In total, 41
      OXA-48-producing Enterobacterales were included in this study (34
      Klebsiella pneumoniae, 3 Escherichia coli, 3 Enterobacter cloacae complex
      and 1 Klebsiella oxytoca). OXA-48-produicng K. pneumoniae (OXAKp) ST383,
      ST147 and ST11 caused outbreaks of different scales in our hospital.
      OXA-48-producing E. coli ST156 and ST648, E. cloacae complex ST414 and
      ST418, and K. oxytoca ST34 were also identified. bla(OXA-48) was embedded
      in a Tn1999.2 structure located in IncL plasmids with different sizes
      (63.58-109.14 kb). Importantly, K. pneumoniae ST11 co-producing KPC-2 and
      OXA-48 was identified in our hospital and it is possible that
      KPC-2-producing K. pneumoniae ST11 obtained the bla(OXA-48)-carrying
      plasmid during its spread. A novel 109-kb bla(OXA-48)-carrying IncL
      plasmid was identified from OXAKp ST11. Possibly, two plasmids in OXAKp
      ST383 were integrated to form this larger plasmid. CONCLUSION:
      OXA-48-produicng Enterobacterales were sporadic in China. Importantly, K.
      pneumoniae ST11 co-producing KPC-2 and OXA-48 has emerged causing an
      outbreak in China. This high-risk multidrug-resistant clone exhibited high
      compatibility and strong integration ability with foreign resistance
      plasmids.

AB  - Neonatal sepsis is a great challenge for clinicians and infection control
      practitioners, especially in facilities with limited resources.
      Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) is rapidly increasing
      and carriages a major threat to neonates. We aimed to examine phenotypes
      causing neonatal late onset sepsis (NLOS) in comparison with neonatal
      early onset sepsis (NEOS) with further investigations of genotypes, and
      genetic relatedness of CRKP in neonatal late-onset sepsis. Our study
      included 88 neonates diagnosed with sepsis: 58 with (NLOS) and 30 with
      (NEOS) from November 2015 to April 2016, at neonatal intensive care unit
      (NICU) of Cairo University Hospital. K. pneumoniae was the most common
      encountered pathogen in the NLOS group (37.9%) with a mean sepsis score of
      6.39 when compared to the NEOS group (p < 0.05). In Klebsiella group,
      C-reactive protein and interleukin-6 levels were significantly high (p ˂
      0.001) and 56.5% of the isolates were meropenem resistant. The most
      prevalent carbapenemase gene was OXA-48 which was identified in 14/23
      (60.8%) followed by NDM-1 which was identified in 12/23 (52.2%) as
      detected by multiplex PCR. Coexistence of both carbapenemases was found in
      52.2% (12/23). The bla(KPC), bla(IMP), and bla(VIM) genes were not
      harbored in the isolates. By investigating the genetic relatedness of CRKP
      by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, 23 isolates of K. pneumoniae revealed
      various pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns, demonstrating
      that the isolates were non-clonal. Awareness of the existing phenotypes
      and genotypes is important for proper treatment and infection control
      practices.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) and
      carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) are difficult to treat and
      are a serious public health threat. Nacubactam (NAC) is a novel
      non-β-lactam diazabicyclooctane β-lactamase inhibitor with in vitro
      activity against some Enterobacterales expressing classes of β-lactamases.
      METHODS: The antimicrobial efficacy of meropenem (MEM), cefepime (FEP),
      and aztreonam (ATM), each in combination with NAC, were assessed in vitro
      and in vivo against Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. Ten
      isolates, including CRE and/or CPE with β-lactamase genes, were used in
      this study. The relationship between phenotype and in vivo efficacy was
      assessed in a murine neutropenic thigh-infection model. Efficacy was
      determined by the change in bacterial quantity. RESULTS: The results of
      the in vitro study showed the minimum inhibitory concentrations of the
      combination of NAC with either MEM, FEP, or ATM in a 1:1 ratio were 2 to
      >128-fold lower than those of MEM, FEP, or ATM alone against CRE+
      isolates. In addition, combinations of β-lactams and NAC administered in
      the murine thigh-infection model showed greater efficacy against
      CRE+/CPE+, CRE+/CPE-, and CRE-/CPE+ isolates harboring various β-lactamase
      genes (IMP-1, IMP-6, KPC, DHA-1, or OXA-48) compared with MEM, FEP, ATM,
      and NAC alone. CONCLUSION: MEM, FEP, or ATM in combination with NAC showed
      potent in vivo antimicrobial activity in a murine thigh-infection model
      caused by K. pneumoniae and E. coli, including CRE and/or CPE isolates.
      These findings indicate that these combinations of β-lactams and NAC are
      potential candidates for the treatment of CRE and/or CPE infections.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-2, metallo-beta-lactamases
      (MBL), and oxacillinase (OXA)-48-like carbapenemases are considered the
      most important carbapenemases. In vitro studies have demonstrated that the
      carbapenemase activity of KPC-2 and MBL can be inhibited by
      3-aminophenylboronic acid and ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA),
      respectively. Understanding the carbapenemase types expressed in
      carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) is of great significance to
      clinical therapies. Liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry
      (LC-MS/MS) is fast, stable, and specific; and is considered the gold
      standard method for measuring small molecules. In this study, we developed
      carbapenemase inhibition tests combined with LC-MS/MS to rapidly identify
      carbapenemase types. A total of 295 clinical isolates were examined,
      including 212 KPC-2 producers, 29 MBL producers, 15 OXA-48-like producers,
      3 KPC-2 + OXA-232 producers, and 36 carbapenem-sensitive strains. We used
      LC-MS/MS to determine the carbapenemase types by measuring the ratio of
      the hydrolyzed meropenem peak areas in the presence and absence of
      different inhibitors. The sensitivity and specificity of LC-MS/MS in
      detecting single KPC-2 producers were 97.64% and 100.00%, respectively,
      and 96.55% and 100.00% for MBL producers, respectively. In addition, the
      sensitivity and specificity of LC-MS/MS in detecting single OXA-48-like
      producers were both 100.00% when extending incubation time up to 2.5 h.
      LC-MS/MS showed excellent agreement in detecting carbapenemase types using
      the modified carbapenem inactivation (mCIM)/EDTA-carbapenem inactivation
      assay (eCIM) (kappa = 0.93 for serine carbapenemases and kappa = 0.98 for
      MBL carbapenemases). In this study, LC-MS/MS demonstrated excellent
      detection of different carbapenemase types, showing potential reliability
      in future clinical applications.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to explore the interactions of polymyxin B in
      combination with 13 other antibiotics against carbapenemase-producing
      Klebsiella pneumoniae. METHODS: Five clinical isolates of
      multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae producing KPC-2, KPC-3, NDM-1, OXA-48
      and VIM-1 carbapenemases were used. Polymyxin B was tested alone and in
      combination with amikacin, aztreonam, cefepime, chloramphenicol,
      ciprofloxacin, fosfomycin, linezolid, meropenem, minocycline, rifampicin,
      temocillin, thiamphenicol and trimethoprim. Inhibition of growth during
      antibiotic exposure was evaluated in 24-hr automated time-lapse microscopy
      experiments. Combinations that showed positive interactions were
      subsequently evaluated in static time-kill experiments. RESULTS: All
      strains carried multiple (≥9) resistance genes as determined by
      whole-genome sequencing. In the initial screening the combination of
      polymyxin B and minocycline was most active with enhanced activity
      compared with the single antibiotics detected against all strains.
      Positive interactions were also observed with polymyxin B in combination
      with rifampicin and fosfomycin against four of five strains and less
      frequently with other antibiotics. Time-kill experiments demonstrated an
      additive or synergistic activity (1-2 log(10) or ≥2 log(10) CFU/mL
      reduction, respectively, compared with the most potent single antibiotic)
      with 21 of 23 tested combinations. However, because of regrowth, only 13
      combinations were synergistic at 24 hr. Combinations with minocycline or
      rifampicin were most active, each showing synergy and bacteriostatic or
      bactericidal effects resulting in 1.93-3.97 and 2.55-5.91 log(10) CFU/mL
      reductions, respectively, after 24 hr against four strains. DISCUSSION:
      Polymyxin B in combination with minocycline, rifampicin or fosfomycin
      could be of potential clinical interest. Time-lapse microscopy showed some
      discrepancy in results compared with the time-kill data but was useful for
      screening purposes.

AB  - Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) have become an important
      public health concern. In our hospital, VIM enzymes were first detected in
      2005, Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) enzymes in 2009, and
      OXA-48 enzymes in 2012. We assess the population biology of the first
      OXA-48-producing Enterobacterales isolates recovered in our hospital (2012
      to 2013) where infections by other carbapenemases had been endemic for
      several years. Over a 21-month period, 71 isolates (61 Klebsiella
      pneumoniae, 5 Escherichia coli, 2 Klebsiella aerogenes, and 1 each of
      Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Citrobacter amalonaticus)
      recovered from clinical and surveillance specimens from 57 patients (22.8%
      nonhospitalized) were investigated for OXA-48-like-producing enzymes.
      Analyses for characterization and determination of the location of the
      bla(OXA-48) gene, plasmid transferability, sequence, and clonal
      relatedness were performed. Most of the isolates also coproduced CTX-M-15
      (57/71, 80.3%) and/or VIM-1 (7/71, 9.8%). K. pneumoniae was predominantly
      identified as sequence type 11 (ST11) (63.4%) and ST405 (9.8%) and E. coli
      as ST540, ST1406, ST3163, and ST4301. The bla(OXA-48) gene was part of
      Tn1999.2 located at the tir gene of plasmids (ca. ≥50 kb) of the IncL/M
      group, also carrying bla(VIM-1) and bla(CTX-M-15) genes. We selected one
      ST11 K. pneumoniae isolate for whole-genome sequencing in which we studied
      the plasmid containing the bla(OXA-48) gene. This plasmid was compared
      with indexed plasmids existing in NCBI database by the use of BRIG and
      MAUVE. Our data suggest a rapid spread of bla(OXA-48) genes between
      commonly isolated high-risk clones of Enterobacterales species, frequently
      associated with antibiotic resistance. Moreover, the emergence of the
      multiresistant ST11 K. pneumoniae clone among nonhospitalized patients
      emphasizes the difficulty of preventing its dissemination into the
      community.IMPORTANCE We present results of microbiological analysis of the
      first Enterobacterales isolates that were isolated in 2012 in our
      institution expressing OXA-48 carbapenemase. This enzyme confers
      resistance to carbapenems, an important group of antibiotics widely used
      in the hospitals. OXA-48 carbapenemase is currently present in many parts
      of the world, but it is found particularly frequently in the Mediterranean
      area. It was disseminated at the Ramón y Cajal Hospital and found to be
      associated with a particular Klebsiella pneumoniae strain, so-called
      high-risk clone ST11, which was previously found in our institution in
      association with other enzymes such as CTX-M-15, VIM-1, and KPC-3. This
      clone might have acquired a plasmid harboring the bla(OXA-48) gene. Our
      results point out the importance of local epidemiology in the
      dissemination and maintenance of multidrug-resistant bacteria.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The dramatic increase in the prevalence and clinical impact
      of infections caused by Carbapenemase-Producing Bacteria in the nosocomial
      setting in Latin America represents an emerging challenge to public
      health. The present study detected carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative
      bacteria in patients from a Hospital from Venezuela, by phenotypic and
      genotypic methods. METHODOLOGY: The bacterial identification was carried
      out using conventional methods. The resistance to carbapenems was
      performed by Kirby-Baüer disk diffusion method, according to CLSI
      recommendations. The modified Hodge Test, double-disk with phenylboronic
      acid, double-disk with EDTA and Blue Carba Test were performed to detect
      phenotypic carbapenemase producers. The carbapenemase-encoding genes
      blaKPC, blaVIM, blaIMP, blaOXA-2, blaOXA-3, blaOXA-15 and blaOXA-21 were
      determined. RESULTS: The bacterial species identified were Klebsiella
      pneumoniae complex (181), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (51), and Acinetobacter
      baumannii-calcoaceticus complex (119). KPC-type was detected in 40.17% of
      isolates and VIM-type in 14.53%. KPC-type gene was only identified in K.
      pneumoniae isolates (77.9%). VIM-type gene was identified in P. aeruginosa
      (86.27%) and K. pneumoniae isolates (3.87%). There was not detection of
      IMP-type and OXA-type genes. CONCLUSIONS: We found a predominance of K.
      pneumoniae KPC producers and a high rate of VIM-producing P. aeruginosa.
      The epidemiology of CPB in Venezuela is rapidly evolving, and enhanced
      surveillance and reporting are needed across the healthcare continuum.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Carbapenemase-producing strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae
      (KPC(+)) are one of the multi-drug resistant bacteria with the highest
      risk for human health. The colistin is the only antibiotic option against
      KPC(+); however, due to its emerging resistance, therapies such as
      antimicrobial photodynamic inactivation (aPDI), are needed. APDI uses
      photosensitizer compounds (PS) to produce light-activated local oxidative
      stress (photooxidative stress). Within the PSs variety, cationic PSs are
      thought to interact closely with the bacterial envelope producing an
      increased cytotoxic effect. METHODOLOGY: The Ir(III)-based cationic
      compounds, PSIR-3, and PSIR-4 were tested on aPDI and compared to a
      positive control of Ru(II)-based PS. The PSIR-3 and PSIR-4 abilities to
      inhibit the growth of KPC(+) and KPC(-) bacteria were evaluated, under 17
      μW/cm(2) photon flux. Also, the cytotoxicity of the PSs in eukaryotic
      cells was determined by MTS and trypan blue exclusion assays. RESULTS:
      After light-activation, only the PSIR-3 compound inhibited 3 log(10) (>
      99.9 %) bacterial growth in a minimum dose of 4 μg/mL with the lethality
      of 30 min of light exposure. Outstandingly, the compound PSIR-3 showed a
      synergistic effect with imipenem, significantly increasing the bacterial
      inhibition of KPC(+) to 6 log(10), which was not observed in the control
      compound. In normal immortalized gastric cell line GES-1, the compound
      PSIR-3 showed no significant cytotoxicity, although increased cytotoxicity
      under light-activation was observed on gastric cancer-derived cells AGS.
      CONCLUSION: The PSIR-3 compound produces an efficient aPDI, killing K.
      pneumoniae KPC(+)- strains, and increasing its susceptibility in
      conjunction with imipenem, exhibiting low cytotoxicity to normal
      eukaryotic cells.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Carbapenem resistance in members of order Enterobacterales
      is a growing public health problem causing high mortality in developing
      and industrialized countries. Its emergence and rapid propagation
      worldwide was due to both intercontinental spread of pandemic strains and
      horizontal dissemination via mobile genetic elements (MGE) such as
      plasmids and transposons. OBJECTIVE: To describe MGE carrying carbapenem
      resistance genes in Enterobacterales which have been reported in South
      America. SEARCH STRATEGY AND SELECTION CRITERIA: A search of the
      literature in English or Spanish published until 2019 in PubMed, Google
      Scholar, LILACS and SciELO databases was performed for studies of MGE in
      Enterobacterales reported in South American countries. RESULTS: Seven
      South American countries reported MGE related to carbapenemases.
      Carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae belonging to clonal complex
      258 were the most prevalent pathogens reported; others
      carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales such as Escherichia coli,
      Serratia marcescens, and Providencia rettgeri also have been reported. The
      MGE implicated in the spread of the most prevalent carbapenemase genes are
      Tn4401 and non-Tn4401 elements for bla(KPC) and ISAba125 for bla(NDM),
      located in different plasmid incompatibility groups, i.e. L/M, A/C, FII
      and bacterial clones. CONCLUSION: This review indicates that, like in
      other parts of the world, the most commonly reported carbapenemases in
      Enterobacterales from South America are being disseminated through clones,
      plasmids, and transposons which have been previously reported in other
      parts of the world.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance is one of the most important public health problem
      and one of the most critical steps in preventing resistance is the
      monitorization of the resistance. Local, regional and global monitoring
      enables the spread of antibiotic resistance to be understood more clearly.
      In this study, it was aimed to evaluate the results of the pilot study for
      the establishment of molecular-based carbapenem surveillance system in
      Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates and to investigate the
      carbapenemase epidemiology in Turkey. Hospitals (n= 28) from 26 different
      statistical level II regions from Turkey were included in the study. The
      hospitals participated in the study submitted ten carbapenem susceptible
      and ten carbapenem resistant E.coli and K.pneumoniae isolates to our
      laboratory that were isolated in two different periiods of six-month
      either between 1 March-31 August or 1 April-30 September 2019. A total of
      509 isolates were collected from 26 of the 28 participating hospitals in
      the study. Isolates were identified by matrix assisted laser
      desorptionization-time of flight mass spectrophotometry (MALDI TOF MS)
      (Bruker Daltonics, Germany) method and antibiotic susceptibility tests for
      imipenem, meropenem and colistin were studied by broth microdilution.
      Moreover, susceptibilities to amikacin, amoxicillin-clavulanic acid,
      ampicillin, aztreonam, cefepime, cefotaxime, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin,
      ertapenem, gentamicin, piperacillin-tazobactam, tobramycin and
      trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole were determined by disc diffusion method.
      The resistance genes were investigated in isolates which were found to be
      phenotypically resistant to carbapenem and colistin, in house method was
      used to investigate carbapenemase genes and a commercial colistin
      resistant real-time PCR kit (Biospeedy, Turkey) was used for colistin
      resistance genes. In total, 493 of the 509 isolates collected from
      hospitals were identified as E.coli (25.7%, n= 127) and K.pneumoniae
      (74.3%, n= 366) and included in the study. It was determined that 31% of
      the isolates evaluated were from community-acquired infections and 69%
      were either from healthcare-associated infections or from colonization
      sites. Among the tested isolates, 248 (50.3%) were susceptible to
      carbapenems and 245 (49.7%) were resistant. The types of carbapenemases in
      carbapenemase-producing were OXA-48 (52.2%), KPC (16.1%), NDM-1 (15%),
      OXA-48 + NDM-1 (12.6%), KPC + NDM-1 (2.8%) and VIM (0.5%) and OXA-48+VIM
      (0.5%). Resistance to colistin was detected in 23.3% of the isolates but
      mcr1-8 genes were not detected. It was found that all colistin resistant
      isolates are resistant to at least one of the carbapenems. The importance
      of a molecular-based antimicrobial resistance surveillance system in our
      country was demonstrated with this pilot study. It is thought that
      continuous monitoring of these epidemiological features will contribute to
      the management of infections due to carbapenemase-producing organisms.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to validate the INCREMENT-CPE score (ICS) in
      patients hospitalized in the intensive care unit (ICU) with bacteraemia
      due to carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (CP-Kp). METHODS: The
      study was conducted in the ICU of the University General Hospital of
      Patras, Greece, during a 10-year period (2010-2019). Patients with
      monomicrobial bacteraemia due to CP-Kp were included. Primary outcome was
      14-day mortality. MICs of meropenem, tigecycline, fosfomycin and
      ceftazidime/avibactam were determined by Etest, whereas for colistin the
      broth microdilution method was applied. PCR for bla(KPC), bla(VIM),
      bla(NDM) and bla(OXA) genes was used. RESULTS: Among 384 CP-Kp
      bacteraemias, most were primary (166, 43.2%) followed by catheter-related
      (143, 37.2%). Most isolates carried bla(KPC) (318, 82.8%). Fourteen-day
      mortality was 26.3% (101 patients). ICS score was 11.1 ± 4.2. An ICS ≥10
      showed a sensitivity of 98.0% and a negative predictive value of 98.7%.
      The area under the curve of ICS (0.800) was comparable to those of the
      Pitt bacteraemia score (0.799), the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II
      (SAPS II) (0.797) and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment score (SOFA)
      (0.815). CONCLUSIONS: ICS showed predictive efficacy similar to that of
      the SAPS II, SOFA and Pitt bacteraemia scores.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae simultaneously carrying genes encoding carbapenem
      resistance and hypervirulence causes fatal infections, representing a
      severe threat to human health. These carbapenem-resistant and
      hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvCRKP) strains are increasingly reported
      worldwide and have been found to belong to a variety of sequence types
      (STs). In this study, we report and characterized an hvCRKP strain of
      ST592, an uncommon ST, which caused a fatal infection in intensive care
      unit (ICU) in China and represents a novel type of hvCRKP. We demonstrated
      that this novel hvCRKP type emerged from the carbapenem-susceptible
      hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKP) lineage of the K57 capsular type. K57
      hvKP contains a pLVPK-like virulence plasmid and then acquired a
      conjugative bla (KPC-2)-carrying plasmid to form hvCRKP. The pLVPK-like
      virulence plasmid contains no complete conjugation module but was able to
      be transferred by fusion with the conjugative bla (KPC-2)-carrying plasmid
      during conjugation. This represents a new mechanism of simultaneous
      transfer genetic determinants of carbapenem resistance and virulence and
      highlights the undergoing expansion of hvCRKP, which requires rigorous
      monitoring and novel countermeasures to curb plasmid-mediated
      transmission.

AB  - Antibiotic-adjuvant combinatory therapy serves as a viable treatment
      option in addressing antibiotic resistance in the clinical setting. This
      study was carried out to assess and characterize the adjuvant potential
      and mode of action of linalool against carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella
      pneumoniae (KPC-KP). Linalool exhibited bactericidal activity alone
      (11,250 μg/ml) and in combination with meropenem (5,625 μg/ml).
      Comparative proteomic analysis showed significant reduction in the number
      of cytoplasmic and membrane proteins, indicating membrane damage in
      linalool-treated KPC-KP cells. Upregulation of oxidative stress regulator
      proteins and downregulation of oxidative stress-sensitive proteins
      indicated oxidative stress. Zeta potential measurement and outer membrane
      permeability assay revealed that linalool increases the bacterial surface
      charge as well as the membrane permeability. Intracellular leakage of
      nucleic acid and proteins was detected upon linalool treatment. Scanning
      and transmission electron microscopies further revealed the breakage of
      bacterial membrane and loss of intracellular materials. Linalool induced
      oxidative stress by generating reactive oxygen species (ROS) which
      initiates lipid peroxidation, leading to damage of the bacterial membrane.
      This leads to intracellular leakage, eventually killing the KPC-KP cells.
      Our study demonstrated that linalool possesses great potential in future
      clinical applications as an adjuvant along with existing antibiotics
      attributed to their ability in disrupting the bacterial membrane by
      inducing oxidative stress. This facilitates the uptake of antibiotics into
      the bacterial cells, enhancing bacterial killing.

AB  - The emergence of plasmids coharboring hypervirulence (Hv) and multidrug
      resistance (MDR) genes has further accelerated the spread of MDR-Hv
      Klebsiella pneumoniae (MDR-HvKP) strains, having a severe impact on public
      health. Here, we report an MDR-Hv superplasmid coharboring hypervirulence
      and MDR genes and the detailed characterization of its genetic and
      phenotypic features. This plasmid was identified in an ST11 (sequence type
      11)-K64 carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (CR-HvKP) strain,
      SZS128, which was responsible for a bloodstream infection in a 21-year-old
      female. Susceptibility testing showed that SZS128 was resistant to
      amikacin, levofloxacin, and almost all of the β-lactams examined. SZS128
      showed high virulence in a Galleria mellonella survival assay and a mouse
      intraperitoneal infection model. Genomic analysis showed that SZS128 not
      only possessed a KPC plasmid (pSZS128-KPC) but also carried a superplasmid
      (pSZS128-Hv-MDR) coharboring hypervirulence and MDR genes and possessing
      complete conjugative regions. Conjugation and transformation assays
      confirmed the potential for horizontal transfer and the high stability
      (retention rate of >95%) of the pSZS128-Hv-MDR superplasmid. Furthermore,
      growth curve assessment confirmed that there was no increase in the
      fitness cost in the presence of pSZS128-Hv-MDR. Therefore, we define a
      superplasmid as a plasmid fulfilling all the following criteria: (i) a
      single plasmid that coharbors hypervirulence and MDR genes, (ii) a plasmid
      that harbors complete conjugative elements that guarantee
      self-transmissibility, (iii) a plasmid that is stable and conserved, and
      (iv) a plasmid with no fitness cost to the host strain. The emergence of
      this kind of superplasmid could represent a serious threat to public
      health, and urgent control measures must be implemented. IMPORTANCE This
      self-transmissible superplasmid, which simultaneously carries
      hypervirulence and MDR genes, greatly enhances the challenges to clinical
      prevention and control and anti-infection treatment. Thus, active
      surveillance of this type of superplasmid is needed to prevent these
      efficient resistance/virulence plasmids from disseminating in hospital
      settings. Our findings provide a reference for defining the term
      "superplasmid" and emphasize the importance of raising public awareness of
      the rapid dissemination of this self-transmissible superplasmid and the
      consistent emergence of MDR-HvKP strains.

      Carbapenemase Gene Copy Number Estimation

AB  - Carbapenemase production is one of the leading mechanisms of carbapenem
      resistance in Gram-negative bacteria. An increase in carbapenemase gene
      (blaCarb) copies is an important mechanism of carbapenem resistance. No
      currently available bioinformatics tools allow for reliable detection and
      reporting of carbapenemase gene copy numbers. Here, we describe the
      carbapenemase-encoding gene copy number estimator (CCNE), a ready-to-use
      bioinformatics tool that was developed to estimate blaCarb copy numbers
      from whole-genome sequencing data. Its performance on Klebsiella
      pneumoniae carbapenemase gene (bla(KPC)) copy number estimation was
      evaluated by simulation and quantitative PCR (qPCR), and the results were
      compared with available algorithms. CCNE has two components, CCNE-acc and
      CCNE-fast. CCNE-acc detects blaCarb copy number in a comprehensive and
      high-accuracy way, while CCNE-fast rapidly screens blaCarb copy numbers.
      CCNE-acc achieved the best accuracy (100%) and the lowest root mean
      squared error (RMSE; 0.07) in simulated noise data sets, compared to the
      assembly-based method (23.4% accuracy, 1.697 RMSE) and the OrthologsBased
      method (78.9% accuracy, 0.395 RMSE). In the qPCR validation, a high
      consistency was observed between the bla(KPC) copy number determined by
      qPCR and that determined with CCNE. Reverse transcription-qPCR
      transcriptional analysis of 40 isolates showed that bla(KPC) expression
      was positively correlated with the bla(KPC) copy numbers detected by CCNE
      (P < 0.001). An association study of 357 KPC-producing K. pneumoniae
      isolates and their antimicrobial susceptibility identified a significant
      association between the estimated bla(KPC) copy number and MICs of
      imipenem (P < 0.001) and ceftazidime-avibactam (P < 0.001). Overall, CCNE
      is a useful genomic tool for the analysis of antimicrobial resistance
      genes copy number; it is available at https://github.com/biojiang/ccne.
      IMPORTANCE Globally disseminated carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales is
      an urgent threat to public health. The most common carbapenem resistance
      mechanism is the production of carbapenemases. Carbapenemase-producing
      isolates often exhibit a wide range of carbapenem MICs. Higher carbapenem
      MICs have been associated with treatment failure. The increase of
      carbapenemase gene (blaCarb) copy numbers contributes to increased
      carbapenem MICs. However, blaCarb gene copy number detection is not
      routinely conducted during a genomic analysis, in part due to the lack of
      optimal bioinformatics tools. In this study, we describe a ready-to-use
      tool we developed and designated the carbapenemase-encoding gene copy
      number estimator (CCNE) that can be used to estimate the blaCarb copy
      number directly from whole-genome sequencing data, and we extended the
      data to support the analysis of all known blaCarb genes and some other
      antimicrobial resistance genes. Furthermore, CCNE can be used to
      interrogate the correlations between genotypes and susceptibility
      phenotypes and to improve our understanding of antimicrobial resistance
      mechanisms.

AB  - In recent years, Serratia marcescens has emerged as an important agent of
      hospital-acquired infections, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infection,
      septicaemia and meningitis, particularly in vulnerable patients. Compared
      to Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, S. marcescens is less
      commonly associated with bla (KPC) genes, yet few cases of plasmid
      transmission at the gastrointestinal level from K. pneumoniae
      carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Enterobacterales to S. marcescens have been
      described. Here we report a case of in vivo acquisition, during a 3-month
      period of hospitalization in the intensive care unit, of a bla (KPC-3)
      gene carried by a pKpQIL-IT plasmid, and its probable transmission at the
      bronchial level among different species of Enterobacterales, including K.
      pneumoniae and S. marcescens. By using whole genome sequence analyses we
      were able provide insight into the dynamics of carbapenem-resistance
      determinants acquisition in the lower respiratory tract, a novel
      anatomical region for such plasmid transmission events, that usually
      involve the gastrointestinal tract. The co-presence at the same time of
      both wild-type and resistant Enterobacterales could have been the critical
      factor leading to the spread of plasmids harbouring carbapenem-resistance
      genes, of particular importance during surveillance screenings. The
      possibility of such an event may have significant consequences in terms of
      antimicrobial treatment, with a potential limitation of therapeutic
      options, thereby further complicating the clinical management of high-risk
      critically ill patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the hypothesis that intestinal colonization by
      different types of carbapenemase-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-Kp)
      leads to different risks for bloodstream infections (BSI) caused by the
      same colonizing organism. METHODS: Prospective observational study
      including consecutive CR-Kp rectal carriers admitted to the Pisa
      University Hospital (December 2018 to December 2019). Patients underwent
      rectal swabbing with molecular testing for the different carbapenemases at
      hospital admission and during hospitalization. Rectal carriers were
      classified as: NDM, KPC, VIM and OXA-48. The primary end point was the
      rate of BSI by the same colonizing organism in each study group. A
      multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify
      factors independently associated with the risk for BSI by the colonizing
      organism. RESULTS: Of 677 rectal carriers, 382/677 (56.4%) were colonized
      by NDM, 247/677 (36.5%) by KPC, 39/677 (5.8%) by VIM and 9/677 (1.3%) by
      OXA-48. Dissemination of NDM-Kp was mostly sustained by ST147, while
      KPC-Kp belonged to ST512. A higher rate of BSI was documented in NDM
      rectal carriers compared with KPC rectal carriers (59/382, 15.4% versus
      20/247, 8.1%, p 0.004). Incidence rates of BSI per 100 patients/month were
      significantly higher in the NDM group (22.33, 95% CI 17.26-28.88) than in
      the KPC group (9.56, 95% CI 6.17-14.82). On multivariate analysis,
      multi-site extraintestinal colonization, solid organ transplantation,
      invasive procedures, intravascular device, admission to intensive care
      unit, cephalosporin, fluoroquinolones and NDM rectal colonization (OR
      3.27, 95% CI 1.73-6.18, p < 0.001) were independently associated with BSI.
      CONCLUSIONS: NDM-Kp was associated with increased risk of BSI compared
      with KPC-Kp. This finding seems to be strongly related to the high-risk
      clone ST147.

AB  - The spread of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) worldwide
      remains a major threat to public health. Notably, carbapenemase-encoding
      genes are usually located in plasmids harboring other resistance
      determinants, and isolates having multiple plasmids are often highly
      resistant to carbapenems. In this study, we characterized the genetic
      context of coproduction of KPC-2, VIM-1, and FosA3 via two plasmids in the
      multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae sequence type 11 (ST11) isolate
      JS187, recovered during an outbreak of KPC-2-producing K. pneumoniae in a
      Chinese teaching hospital in 2008. Plasmid p187-1, coharboring bla(VIM-1)
      and fosA3, consisted of a pKOX-R1-like backbone and two multidrug
      resistant (MDR) regions separated by pKHS1-like backbone sequences
      involving plasmid replication and stability. The MDR region 1 was a
      chimera composed of the bla(VIM-1)-bearing In916-like integron and
      Tn1721-like transposon, and was disrupted by sequential insertion of an
      IS26-based transposition unit carrying bla(CTX-M-3) and a ΔTn3-like
      transposon bearing bla(TEM-1). MDR region 2 was an IS26-array structure
      with fosA3 and bla(SHV-12). Plasmid p187-2 harboring bla(KPC-2) was
      closely related to pKP048. bla(KPC-2) in p187-2 was carried by a Tn1721
      variant, which differed from the prototype Tn1721-bla(KPC-2) transposon
      observed in pKP048 by disruption of an IS26 at Tn3 and deletion of a 31-kb
      MDR fragment. Co-existence of the novel VIM-1- and FosA3-encoding MDR
      plasmid p187-1 and the KPC-2-encoding pKP048-like plasmid p187-2 made K.
      pneumoniae JS187 highly resistant to carbapenems. Moreover, p187-1 still
      carried genes conferring resistance to cephalosporins, fosfomycin,
      chloramphenicol, and quaternary ammonium, posing substantial challenges
      for the treatment of Enterobacteriaceae infections. Thus, monitoring the
      prevalence and evolution of these plasmids and/or strains is critical.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Donor-derived carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP)
      infection has recently emerged as a critical early complication after
      renal transplantation. Although CRKP is usually sensitive to tigecycline,
      monotherapy with this drug is often less than effective. We investigated
      the efficacy of a combined regimen of tigecycline with high-dose,
      extended-infusion meropenem in the treatment of donor-derived CRKP
      infection after kidney transplantation. METHODS: From Jan. 2016 to Dec.
      2017, a total of 12 CRKP isolates were detected from cultures of the organ
      preservation solution used for soaking the donor kidneys at our institute.
      Probable or possible donor-derived infection (DDI) was identified in 8
      transplant recipients. Clinical data were retrospectively analyzed.
      RESULTS: Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-2 (KPC-2)-producing CRKP was
      reported to be positive in organ preservation solution cultures at 3.5±0.9
      days after transplantation, leading to surgical site (n=3), urinary tract
      (n=4), and/or bloodstream (n=2) infections in 8 recipients. The drug
      susceptibility tests showed that CRKP was sensitive to tigecycline, but
      resistant to meropenem. In 7 patients who received tigecycline combined
      with high-dose extended-infusion meropenem, DDIs were successfully cured.
      The length of hospital stay was 31 (18-129) days, and the serum creatinine
      at discharge was 105.8±16.7 µmol/L. The one remaining patient who received
      tigecycline combined with intravenous-drip meropenem died of septic shock.
      A median follow-up of 43 months (33-55) showed no recurrence of new CRKP
      infection in the 7 surviving recipients. CONCLUSION: It was suggested that
      a prompt and appropriate combination therapy using tigecycline with
      high-dose extended-infusion meropenem is effective in treating
      donor-derived KPC-2-producing CRKP infection after renal transplantation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing
      K.pneumoniae has represented a serious health problem in worldwide. The
      resistance to ceftazidime-avibactam (CAZ-AVI) began to emerge since its
      approval in 2015. We aim to explore the resistance mechanism of CAZ-AVI.
      METHODS: Phenotypic test and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) analysis were
      performed in KP-HX0917 and KP-HX1016 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates,
      collected from the same patient following treatment with CAZ-AVI. RESULTS:
      We report a case of emergence of CAZ-AVI resistance in ST 11
      KPC-2-producing K. pneumoniae (KP-HX1016) during 14 days of exposure with
      CZA-AVI. Molecular analysis highlighted the A533C mutation in the blaKPC-2
      gene, resulting a D179A substitution in protein sequence, which restored
      the hydrolysis ability of imipenem and meropenem, but not for ertapenem,
      and the result of phenotypic test was negative. However, KP-HX0917
      produced serine-carbapenemase by phenotypic detection and lost its
      capacity of hydrolyzing carbapenems. CONCLUSION: The emergence of CAZ-AVI
      resistance should arouse our attention, the susceptibility testing should
      be followed by a combination of phenotypic and molecular methods, to make
      sure that no potential carbapenemase-producing bacteria are missed.

AB  - BACKGROUND Multi-resistant microorganisms are a public health problem.
      Their incidence has risen due to COVID-19, indiscriminate antibiotics use,
      corticosteroid treatments, and higher admissions to intensive care units
      (ICUs) of patients requiring invasive mechanical ventilation. These are
      risk factors for bacterial over-infection. The present case study that is
      relevant because of the multiple isolated strains with a resistance
      pattern: Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPC), extended-spectrum
      beta lactamases (ESBL) and New Delhi metallo-ß-lactamase (NDM) in a
      patient without comorbidities. CASE REPORT A 53-year-old Ecuadorian man
      with no past medical history arrived at the Emergency Department (ED) with
      dyspnea, nasopharyngeal swab with a positive reverse transcription
      polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) test for SARS-CoV2, and a chest
      computed tomography (CT) scan showing bilateral ground-glass pulmonary
      infiltrates with 40% involvement. On day 10 in the ICU, the presence of
      Klebsiella pneumoniae KPC strain was reported in an axillary swab culture.
      Consequently, the antibiotic was rotated to vancomycin 1 g intravenously
      (i.v.) every 12 h and meropenem 1 g i.v. every 8 h. On day 15 in the ICU,
      a tracheal secretion culture was reported with the presence of Klebsiella
      pneumoniae ESBL and a blood culture with Klebsiella pneumoniae NDM.
      CONCLUSIONS The COVID-19 pandemic is a perfect scenario for superinfection
      with multi-resistant pathogens such as carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella
      pneumoniae (CRKP), due to the increase in patients admitted to ICUs
      requiring invasive mechanical ventilation, the use of corticosteroids, and
      empirical broad-spectrum antibiotic management based on guidelines. The
      emergence of combined multidrug-resistant strains is a challenge for
      laboratory detection and the selection of antimicrobial treatment.

      bacteria can cause infections in cases involving lower lumbar
      interventions as its closer to the perianal area. Here we report an
      uncommon fatal wound infection caused by a multidrug-resistant Klebsiella
      pneumoniae after an elective spine surgery. In silico analysis revealed
      that LWI_ST16 belonged to ST16, an emergent international clone notable
      for its increased virulence potential. We also observed that this strain
      carried a conjugative IncF plasmid encoding resistance genes to
      beta-lactams (bla(KPC-2) and bla(OXA-1)), tetracycline (tetA),
      aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones (aac(6')-Ib-cr). The carbapenemase
      encoding gene bla(KPC-2) was located on a Tn4401e transposon previously
      characterized to increase bla(KPC) expression. LWI_ST16 is a strong
      biofilm producer on polystyrene and capable of forming tower-like
      structures on a titanium device like the one inserted in the patient's
      spine. Our findings strengthen the valuable contribution of continuous
      surveillance of multidrug-resistant and high-risk K. pneumoniae clones to
      avoid unfavourable clinical outcomes.

AB  - Accurate species identification and antibiotic resistance profiling are
      essential for the effective management of infections caused by bacterial
      pathogens. In this study, 373 clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae from
      major hospitals in Trinidad, West Indies, were characterized for
      resistance against beta-lactam antibiotics and the presence of genes
      encoding important virulence factors. Most of the isolates showed extended
      spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) activity but few also displayed carbapenemase
      or 'ESBL + carbapenemase' activities. Polymerase chain reaction analysis
      revealed the presence of genes for ESBL subtypes bla(TEM), bla(SHV), and
      bla(CTX-M) that were dominant in isolates with the ESBL phenotype as well
      as those that did not show ESBL or carbapenemase activities. The
      carbapenem resistance gene, bla(KPC), and the metallo-β-lactamase (MBL)
      gene, bla(NDM-1), were also detected in some of the isolates. Multiple
      virulence genes were also detected, but the fimH-uge was the most common
      combination found among the local isolates. The findings of this study
      represent the first comprehensive study on the prevalence of ESBL, KPC and
      MBL genes and virulence profiling in antibiotic-resistant K. pneumoniae in
      Trinidad. Furthermore, the occurrence of multiple resistant phenotypes and
      gene combinations were revealed, though at low prevalence rates. This work
      emphasizes the need to implement molecular-based techniques in diagnostic
      workflows for rapid and accurate species identification and profiling of
      resistance and virulence genes in K. pneumoniae in Trinidad and Tobago.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) represents a critical obstacle to public
      health worldwide, due to the high incidence of strains resistant to
      available antibiotic therapies. In recent years, there has been a
      significant increase in the prevalence of resistant epidemic strains,
      associated with this, public health authorities have been alarmed about a
      possible scenario of uncontrolled dissemination of these microorganisms
      and the difficulty in interrupting their transmission, as nosocomial
      pathogens with resistance profiles previously considered sporadic. They
      become frequent bacteria in the community. In addition, therapy for
      infections caused by these pathogens is based on broad-spectrum antibiotic
      therapy, which favors an increase in the tolerance of remaining bacterial
      cells and is commonly associated with a poor prognosis. In this review, we
      present the current status of epidemic strains of methicillin-resistant
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), MDR
      Mycobacterium tuberculosis, extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing
      Enterobacterales (ESBL), Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC),

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) pose a serious
      threat to clinical patient management and public health, as they are
      generally resistant to most antibiotics and cause infections with high
      mortality rates. Klebsiella pneumoniae ranks second among
      Enterobacteriaceae species that cause nosocomial infections. In this
      study, we investigated the epidemic characteristics of
      carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP) in the pediatric intensive care
      unit (PICU) of Yanbian University Hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total
      of 14 non-duplicate CRKP strains, collected from March 2015 to November
      2019, were subjected to automated microbial identification and
      antimicrobial susceptibility tests using the Phoenix-100 ID/AST system.
      The strains were also subjected to genotypic resistance testing,
      polymerase chain reaction assays to detect genes encoding carbapenemases
      and other β-lactamases, multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), and
      pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)-based homology analysis. RESULTS:
      Two carbapenemase genes, KPC-2 and NDM-1 (in eight and six strains,
      respectively), were detected. MLST enabled the division of the strains
      into two sequence types, ST11 and ST1224 (containing eight and six
      strains, respectively). PFGE results classified the 14 strains into
      clonotypes A-D, of which clonotypes A and B belonged to ST11, while
      clonotypes C and D belonged to ST1224. CONCLUSION: Our study reveals that
      epidemics of the KPC-2-ST11 and NDM-1-ST1224 strains occurred in the PICU
      of Yanbian University Hospital. Surveillance and strict implementation of
      prevention and control measures are crucial to prevent the occurrence and
      rapid spread of nosocomial infections.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae strain KPB-1 was isolated in early 2011 from the
      pleural fluid of an inpatient admitted at an Italian hospital. It was
      characterized to produce the KPC-3 carbapenemase and to belong to sequence
      type 512, a derivative of sequence type 258 clade II characterized by the
      cps-2 gene cluster. The K-antigen of K. pneumoniae KPB-1 was purified and
      its structure determined by using GLC-MS of appropriate carbohydrate
      derivatives and 1D and 2D NMR spectroscopy of the native polysaccharide.
      All the collected data demonstrated the following repeating unit for the
      K. pneumoniae KPB-1 capsular polysaccharide: The reactions catalysed by
      each glycosyltransferase in the cps-2 gene cluster were assigned on the
      basis of structural homology with other Klebsiella K antigens.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) infections have
      been occasionally described in patients with coronavirus disease-19
      (COVID-19). We assess the clinical features and outcome of these
      infections. METHODS: In this retrospective single-centre, case-control
      study, we included 54 patients with CPE infection: 30 case-patients
      (COVID-19) and 24 controls (non-COVID-19), collected between March and May
      2020. We compared the epidemiological, clinical features, and outcome
      between cases and controls. RESULTS: CPE infection was more frequent in
      COVID-19 patients than in controls (1.1 vs. 0.5%, p = .005). COVID-19
      patients were younger, had a lower frequency of underlying diseases (p =
      .01), and a lower median Charlson score (p = .002). Predisposing factors
      such as antimicrobial use, mechanical ventilation, or ICU admission, were
      more frequent in COVID-19 patients (p < .05). There were 73 episodes of
      infection (42 cases and 31 controls) that were more frequently
      hospital-acquired and diagnosed at the ICU in COVID-19 patients (p <
      .001). Urinary tract was the most common source of infection (47.9%),
      followed by pneumonia (23.3%). The frequency of severe sepsis or shock (p
      = .01) as well as the median SOFA score (p = .04) was higher in cases than
      in controls. Klebsiella pneumoniae (80.8%), Serratia marcescens (11%) and
      Enterobacter cloacae (4.1%) were the most common bacteria in both groups
      (KPC 56.2%, OXA-48 26% and VIM 17.8%). Overall 30-d mortality rate of
      COVID-19 patients and controls was 30 and 16.7%, respectively (p = .25).
      CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients have an increased risk of CPE infections,
      which usually present as severe, nosocomial infections, appearing in
      critically-ill patients and associated with a high mortality.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: In Greece, the spread of carbapenem-resistant
      Enterobacteriaceae in humans has led to the reintroduction of colistin as
      a therapeutic agent. Unfortunately, colistin resistance with different
      mechanisms has emerged. The present work aims to determine the prevalence
      of carbapenem and colistin resistance and the corresponding mechanisms in
      Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical isolates from Greece. METHODS: From 2014 to
      2017, 288 carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae clinical strains were
      gathered from a collection of 973 isolates from eight different hospitals
      in Greece. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed using three
      different methods. Screening of carbapenem and colistin resistance genes
      was conducted using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and
      sequencing. RESULTS: Among the 288 (29.6 %) carbapenem-resistant isolates,
      213 (73.9%) were colistin-resistant (minimum inhibitory concentration
      [MIC] >2 mg/L). The KPC type was the most common carbapenemase gene (116;
      40.3%), followed by VIM (41; 14.2%), NDM (33; 11.5%) and OXA-48 (22;
      7.6%). Moreover, 44 (15.3%) strains co-produced two types of
      carbapenemases. No mcr genes were detected for colistin resistance but
      mutations in chromosomal genes were found. These included inactivation of
      the mgrB gene for 148 (69.5%) strains, including insertion sequences for
      94 (44.1%), nonsense mutations for 4 (1.9%) and missense mutations for 24
      (11.3%). Moreover, PCR amplification of mgrB gene was negative for 26
      (12.2%) strains. Finally, 65 (30.5%) colistin-resistant strains exhibited
      a wild-type mgrB, the mechanisms of which remain to be elucidated.
      CONCLUSION: This study shows that K. pneumoniae clinical strains in Greece
      are resistant to both carbapenems and colistin and this is endemic and is
      likely chromosomally encoded.

AB  - Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) strains pose a
      significant threat to public health. In this study, a survey was conducted
      in the Jiangxi Province of China, covering a total of 140 CRKP strains
      collected from 11 hospital laboratories from June 2016 to January 2018.
      All CRKP isolates were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing,
      capsular serotypes, virulence gene profiles, multilocus sequence typing,
      and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. The differences in the patient
      characteristics and distributions among the various regions were
      statistically significant (p ≤ 0.001). Most patients were hospitalized in
      intensive care units (30.0%) and burn departments (13.6%), with lower
      respiratory (52.1%) and urinary tract (15.7%) infections being most
      prevalent. A higher ratio of CRKP isolates were identified in the southern
      and central regions of Jiangxi than in the other regions. Only two
      carbapenemase genes, bla(KPC) and bla(NDM), were responsible for
      phenotypic resistance in the tested CRKP strains (46.5% and 22.1%,
      respectively), among which several major sequence types (STs), such as
      ST11 (27.8%) and ST23 (14.8%), were identified. A total of 39 virulent
      strains were detected, of which 22 strains were classified by capsule
      serotyping. Hypervirulent genes were most common in the eastern and
      central regions of Jiangxi. In conclusion, CRKP strains in the Jiangxi
      Province have varied geographic distributions; the resistance rates of
      isolates harboring bla(KPC) decreased from southern to northern regions,
      whereas the drug resistance gene bla(NDM) showed a tendency to spread from
      a central point to the surrounding areas. ST23 carbapenem-resistant
      hypervirulent K. pneumoniae is emerging, resulting in an urgent need to
      enhance clinical awareness.

AB  - Combined antibiotic therapy is widely used for infections caused by
      carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae. The objective of this work was to
      identify the synergistic activity of combinations of two carbapenems
      against multidrug- and extensively drug-resistant K. pneumoniae strains
      producing various types of carbapenemases. For 60 antibiotic-resistant K.
      pneumoniae strains isolated in 8 cities of Belarus, the minimum inhibitory
      concentrations (MIC) of colistin and carbapenems were determined by
      subsequent broth microdilution method, and the genes of carbapenemases and
      phosphoethanolamine transferases were detected. The checkerboard method
      was used to determine the sensitivity to the combination of ertapenem and
      doripenem. High MIC values of carbapenems were revealed for NDM
      carbapenemase-producing strains (MIC50 of meropenem 64 mg/L, MIC50 of
      doripenem 64 mg/L). Doripenem was more active; MIC of doripenem ≤ 16 mg/L
      (low level of resistance) was determined in 28 (46.7%) strains, MIC of
      meropenem ≤ 16 mg/L - in 8 (13.3% of strains). The effect of potentiating
      the activity of doripenem with ertapenem at a fixed pharmacokinetic /
      pharmacodynamic concentration was observed for 20.0% of the strains
      producing KPC carbapenemase and 29.0% of the strains producing OXA-48
      carbapenemase. The potentiating effect was independent of the presence of
      colistin resistance. Thus, the ability of ertapenem to potentiate the
      antimicrobial activity of doripenem and meropenem against some of the
      strains producing serine carbapenemases (KPC and OXA-48) was confirmed.
      The necessity of routine determination of the true MIC values of
      carbapenems was shown to optimize their dosage regimens and select the
      combination antibiotic therapy regimens.

AB  - Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKp) is an urgent public
      health threat. Worldwide dissemination of CRKp has been largely attributed
      to clonal group (CG) 258. However, recent evidence indicates the global
      emergence of a CRKp CG307 lineage. Houston, TX, is the first large city in
      the United States with detected cocirculation of both CRKp CG307 and
      CG258. We sought to characterize the genomic and clinical factors
      contributing to the parallel endemic spread of CG258 and CG307. CRKp
      isolates were collected as part of the prospective, Consortium on
      Resistance against Carbapenems in Klebsiella and other Enterobacterales 2
      (CRACKLE-2) study. Hybrid short-read and long-read genome assemblies were
      generated from 119 CRKp isolates (95 originated from Houston hospitals). A
      comprehensive characterization of phylogenies, gene transfer, and plasmid
      content with pan-genome analysis was performed on all CRKp isolates.
      Plasmid mating experiments were performed with CG307 and CG258 isolates of
      interest. Dissection of the accessory genomes suggested independent
      evolution and limited horizontal gene transfer between CG307 and CG258
      lineages. CG307 contained a diverse repertoire of mobile genetic elements,
      which were shared with other non-CG258 K. pneumoniae isolates. Three
      unique clades of Houston CG307 isolates clustered distinctly from other
      global CG307 isolates, indicating potential selective adaptation of
      particular CG307 lineages to their respective geographical niches. CG307
      strains were often isolated from the urine of hospitalized patients,
      likely serving as important reservoirs for genes encoding carbapenemases
      and extended-spectrum β-lactamases. Our findings suggest parallel
      cocirculation of high-risk lineages with potentially divergent evolution.
      IMPORTANCE The prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae
      (CRKp) infections in nosocomial settings remains a public health
      challenge. High-risk clones such as clonal group 258 (CG258) are
      particularly concerning due to their association with bla(KPC) carriage,
      which can severely complicate antimicrobial treatments. There is a recent
      emergence of clonal group 307 (CG307) worldwide with little understanding
      of how this successful clone has been able to adapt while cocirculating
      with CG258. We provide the first evidence of potentially divergent
      evolution between CG258 and CG307 with limited sharing of adaptive genes.
      Houston, TX, is home to the largest medical center in the world, with a
      large influx of domestic and international patients. Thus, our unique
      geographical setting, where two pandemic strains of CRKp are circulating,
      provides an indication of how differential accessory genome content can
      drive stable, endemic populations of CRKp. Pan-genomic analyses such as
      these can reveal unique signatures of successful CRKp dissemination, such
      as the CG307-associated plasmid (pCG307_HTX), and provide invaluable
      insights into the surveillance of local carbapenem-resistant
      Enterobacterales (CRE) epidemiology.

      amino acids

AB  - Aztreonam/avibactam is a promising antimicrobial combination with
      additional coverage for metallo-β-lactamases compared with
      ceftazidime/avibactam. A carbapenem-resistant bla(KPC-2)-carrying
      Escherichia coli clinical isolate had four extra amino acids in
      penicillin-binding protein 3 (PBP3), which has been known to mediate
      reduced susceptibility to aztreonam/avibactam. This prompted us to
      investigate whether the strain could develop resistance to
      aztreonam/avibactam after exposure to the combination. A mutant with
      high-level resistance to aztreonam/avibactam [minimum inhibitory
      concentration (MIC), 512/4 mg/L] was obtained after 5-day exposure to 0.5
      × MIC but it remained susceptible to ceftazidime/avibactam (MIC, 4/4
      mg/L). The mutant had a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in bla(KPC-2)
      to encode KPC-21 with a Trp105Arg amino acid substitution. By cloning into
      E. coli BL21, bla(KPC-21) could mediate reduced susceptibility to
      aztreonam/avibactam (MIC, from ≤0.03/4 to 1/4 mg/L), which was still below
      the breakpoint to define resistance. In contrast, when bla(KPC-21) was
      cloned in E. coli 035125ΔpCMY42 with four extra amino acids in PBP3, which
      was generated in our previous work, the strain exhibited high-level
      resistance to aztreonam/avibactam (MIC, 256/4 mg/L). The above findings
      highlight that although aztreonam/avibactam has a broader spectrum than
      ceftazidime/avibactam, strains may develop resistance to the former
      combination but remain susceptible to the latter. The discrepancy is due
      to mutation of KPC-2 to KPC-21 in combination with the insertion of four
      extra amino acids in PBP3.

TI  - Comparative genome analysis of colistin-resistant OXA-48-producing
      Klebsiella pneumoniae clinical strains isolated from two Iranian hospitals

AB  - BACKGROUND: Carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (CP-KP) is
      becoming extensively disseminated in Iranian medical centers. Colistin is
      among the few agents that retains its activity against CP-KP. However, the
      administration of colistin for treatment of carbapenem-resistant
      infections has increased resistance against this antibiotic. Therefore,
      the identification of genetic background of co-carbapenem,
      colistin-resistance K. pneumoniae (Co-CCRKp) is urgent for implementation
      of serious infection control strategies. METHODS: Fourteen Co-CCRKp
      strains obtained from routine microbiological examinations were subjected
      to molecular analysis of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) using whole genome
      sequencing (WGS). RESULTS: Nine of 14 K. pneumoniae strains belonged to
      sequence type (ST)-11 and 50% of the isolates had K-locus type 15. All
      strains carried bla(OXA-48) except for P26. bla(NDM-1) was detected in
      only two plasmids associated with P6 and P26 strains belonging to
      incompatibility (Inc) groups; IncFIB, IncHI1B and IncFII. No bla(KPC),
      bla(VIM) and bla(IMP) were identified. Multi-drug resistant (MDR)
      conjugative plasmids were identified in strains P6, P31, P35, P38 and P40.
      MIC(colistin) of K. pneumoniae strains ranged from 4 to 32 µg/ml.
      Modification of PmrA, PmrB, PhoQ, RamA and CrrB regulators as well as MgrB
      was identified as the mechanism of colistin resistance in our isolates.
      Single amino acid polymorphysims (SAPs) in PhoQ (D150G) and PmrB (R256G)
      were identified in all strains except for P35 and P38. CrrB was absent in
      P37 and modified in P7 (A200E). Insertion of ISKpn72 (P32), establishment
      of stop codon (Q30*) (P35 and P38), nucleotides deletion (P37), and amino
      acid substitution at position 28 were identified in MgrB (P33 and P42).
      None of the isolates were positive for plasmid-mediated colistin
      resistance (mcr) genes. P35 and P38 strains carried iutA, iucD, iucC, iucB
      and iucA genes and are considered as MDR-hypervirulent strains. P6, P7 and
      P43 had ICEKp4 variant and ICEKp3 was identified in 78% of the strains
      with specific carriage in ST11. CONCLUSION: In our study, different
      genetic modifications in chromosomal coding regions of some regulator
      genes resulted in phenotypic resistance to colistin. However, the
      extra-chromosomal colistin resistance through mcr genes was not detected.
      Continuous genomic investigations need to be conducted to accurately
      depict the status of colistin resistance in clinical settings.

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate transitions in resistance mechanisms, virulence
      characteristics and molecular epidemiology of carbapenem-resistant
      Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) during 2003-2016 in a major Eastern Chinese
      medical center. PATIENTS AND METHODS: From a total of 2299 K. pneumoniae
      clinical strains collected from 2003 to 2016, 214 were found to be CRKP
      isolates and were selected for further study. Characterization of these
      was conducted by molecular detection of antibiotic resistance markers and
      virulence determinants, modified carbapenem inactivation method and
      multilocus sequence typing (MLST). RESULTS: In this study, the prevalence
      of CRKP was increasing over the 14-year period, mirroring a national
      trend. These CRKP strains were resistant to most of the tested, clinically
      relevant drugs. The majority of these CRKP strains were positive for
      carbapenemases, with the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) found
      to be the dominant type (207/210, 98.6%). The carrier rates of virulence
      genes uge, entB, fimH, mrkD and ureA increased in 2016, while the ybtA,
      iucA and irp2 showed a relatively constant trend. From MLST data, ST11
      (88.8%, 190/214) was the preponderant sequence type (ST), followed by ST15
      (1.9%, 4/214) and ST656 (1.4%, 3/214). Several strains with less common
      STs (ST690, ST895, ST1823 and ST1384) were also detected, and these too
      showed high levels of antimicrobial resistance. CONCLUSION: The average
      national rise in CRKP across China is mirrored in this in-depth analysis
      of a single hospital, while the prevalence of hypervirulent CRKP (such as
      ST15) was relatively low as of 2016. Continuous monitoring is necessary to
      keep track of CRKP and should include the prospect of newly emerging
      strains with less common STs and the prospect of detecting
      carbapenem-resistant, carbapenemase-negative Klebsiella pneumoniae.

AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the genotype and clinical characteristics of
      carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) strains in southwest China
      and provide information on the treatment stopping the spread of the
      infection. METHODS: The clinical information of CRE isolates was collected
      from 19 hospitals in 12 cities across Sichuan Province, China, between
      June 2018 and April 2019. The isolates were detected by DNA sequencing of
      genes encoding carbapenem enzymes and multilocus sequence types (MLSTs).
      RESULTS: A total of 166 nonrepetitive CRE isolates were isolated during
      the study period from sputum, blood, urine, and other samples. Klebsiella
      pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) was dominant in Klebsiella pneumoniae
      (53.9%), followed by New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM) (42.1%). A total
      of 43 STs were detected. The most common ST of K. pneumoniae was ST11, and
      that of Escherichia coli was ST410. Pairwise single nucleotide
      polymorphism (SNP) distances and the likelihood of local transmission by
      epidemiology were plotted for each species. About 65% of these pairs had ≤
      20 pairwise SNPs. CONCLUSION: A large number of CRE strains carried
      carbapenemase. Although NDM-ST12 K. pneumoniae should not be disregarded,
      KPC-ST11is the predominant strain. Thus, the possibility of transmission
      between E. coli and K. pneumoniae could not be ignored.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multidrug resistant, extremely drug-resistant, pan-drug
      resistant, carbapenem-resistant, and carbapenemase-producing gram-negative
      bacteria are becoming more common in health care settings and are posing a
      growing threat to public health. OBJECTIVE: The study was aimed to detect
      and phenotypically characterize carbapenem no- susceptible gram-negative
      bacilli at the Ethiopian Public Health Institute. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A
      prospective cross-sectional study was conducted from June 30, 2019, to May
      30, 2020, at the national reference laboratory of the Ethiopian Public
      Health Institute. Clinical samples were collected, inoculated, and
      incubated for each sample in accordance with standard protocol.
      Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was conducted using Kirby-Bauer disk
      diffusion method. Identification was done using the traditional
      biochemical method. Multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant
      isolates were classified using a standardized definition established by
      the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control and the United
      States Centers for Disease Prevention and Control. Gram-negative organisms
      with reduced susceptibility to carbapenem antibiotics were considered
      candidate carbapenemase producers and subjected to modified carbapenem
      inactivation and simplified carbapenem inactivation methods. Meropenem
      with EDTA was used to differentiate metallo-β-lactamase (MBL) from serine
      carbapenemase. Meropenem (MRP)/meropenem + phenylboronic acid (MBO) were
      used to differentiate Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) from other
      serine carbapenemase producing gram-negative organisms. RESULTS: A total
      of 1,337 clinical specimens were analyzed, of which 429 gram-negative
      bacterial isolates were recovered. Out of 429 isolates, 319, 74, and 36
      were Enterobacterales, Acinetobacter species, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa
      respectively. In our study, the prevalence of multidrug-resistant,
      extensively drug-resistant, carbapenemase-producing, and carbapenem
      nonsusceptible gram-negative bacilli were 45.2%, 7.7%, 5.4%, and 15.4%
      respectively. Out of 429 isolates, 66 demonstrated reduced susceptibility
      to the antibiotics meropenem and imipenem. These isolates were tested for
      carbapenemase production of which 34.8% (23/66) were carbapenemase
      producers. Out of 23 carbapenemase positive gram-negative bacteria, ten
      (10) and thirteen (13) were metallo-beta-lactamase and serine
      carbapenemase respectively. Three of 13 serine carbapenemase positive
      organisms were Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase. CONCLUSION: This study
      revealed an alarming level of antimicrobial resistance (AMR), with a high
      prevalence of multidrug-resistant (MDR) and extremely drug-resistant,
      carbapenemase-producing gram-negative bacteria, particularly among
      intensive care unit patients at the health facility level. These findings
      point to a scenario in which clinical management of infected patients
      becomes increasingly difficult and necessitates the use of "last-resort"
      antimicrobials likely exacerbating the magnitude of the global AMR crisis.
      This mandates robust AMR monitoring and an infection prevention and
      control program.

AB  - In Brazil, the production of KPC-type carbapenemases in Enterobacteriales
      is endemic, leading to widespread use of polymyxins. In the present study,
      502 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were evaluated for resistance to
      polymyxins, their genetic determinants and clonality, in addition to the
      presence of carbapenem resistance genes and evaluation of antimicrobial
      resistance. Resistance to colistin (polymyxin E) was evaluated through
      initial selection on EMB agar containing 4% colistin sulfate, followed by
      Minimal Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) determination by broth
      microdilution. The susceptibility to 17 antimicrobials was assessed by
      disk diffusion. The presence of bla(KPC), bla(NDM) and bla(OXA-48-like)
      carbapenemases was investigated by phenotypic methods and conventional
      PCR. Molecular typing was performed by PFGE and MLST. Allelic variants of
      the mcr gene were screened by PCR and chromosomal mutations in the pmrA,
      pmrB, phoP, phoQ and mgrB genes were investigated by sequencing. Our work
      showed a colistin resistance frequency of 29.5% (n = 148/502) in K.
      pneumoniae isolates. Colistin MICs from 4 to >128 µg/mL were identified
      (MIC(50) = 64 µg/mL; MIC(90) >128 µg/mL). All isolates were considered
      MDR, with the lowest resistance rates observed for amikacin (34.4%), and
      19.6% of the isolates were resistant to all tested antimicrobials. The
      bla(KPC) gene was identified in 77% of the isolates, in consonance with
      the high rate of resistance to polymyxins related to its use as a
      therapeutic alternative. Through XbaI-PFGE, 51 pulsotypes were identified.
      MLST showed 21 STs, with ST437, ST258 and ST11 (CC11) being the most
      prevalent, and two new STs were determined: ST4868 and ST4869. The mcr-1
      gene was identified in 3 K. pneumoniae isolates. Missense mutations in
      chromosomal genes were identified, as well as insertion sequences in mgrB.
      Furthermore, the identification of chromosomal mutations in K. pneumoniae
      isolates belonging from CC11 ensures its success as a high-risk epidemic
      clone in Brazil and worldwide.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical characteristics and molecular
      epidemiology of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP)
      bloodstream infection at a medical center in northeast China, especially
      after coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. METHODS: Fifty-one patients
      were diagnosed with CRKP bloodstream infection between January 2015 and
      December 2020, among which 42 isolates were available for further study.
      Species identification and antibiotic susceptibilities were tested with
      matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass
      spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and VITEK 2 systems. Carbapenemase genes,
      virulence genes and MLST genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction.
      Moreover, the string test and serum killing assay were performed to
      evaluate the virulence of the CRKP isolates. RESULTS: During the six-year
      period, the detection rate of CRKP in bloodstream infection showed an
      increasing trend, with the intensive care unit, hematology and respiratory
      medicine wards mainly affected. Molecular epidemiology analyses showed
      that KPC-2 was the dominant carbapenemase gene. In addition, the dominant
      sequence type (ST) of CRKP shifted from ST11 to ST15 strains, which were
      all sensitive to amikacin in contrast to the ST11 stains. Furthermore,
      ST15 CRKP strains were positive for the KfuB virulence gene and more
      resistant to serum killing compared to the ST11 CRKP strains. Nonetheless,
      the mortality rate of patients infected with ST11 and ST15 CRKP did not
      show any significant differences. CONCLUSION: A shift in the dominant
      sequence type of CRKP bloodstream infections from ST11 to ST15 was
      observed during the years 2015-2020. Compared to ST11, the ST15 CRKP
      strains showed amikacin sensitivity, positivity for KfuB gene, and serum
      resistance, which may indicate stronger virulence.

AB  - Infections caused by multi drug-resistant gram-negative bacilli are
      increasingly reported worldwide. Colistin, tigecycline and aminoglycosides
      are almost the only and last choice antibiotics in the treatment of
      infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales members.
      Ceftazidime-avibactam is a novel antibiotic combination consisting of a
      broad-spectrum cephalosporin and avibactam with good antimicrobial
      activity against carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales members. The aim of
      this study was to assess the in vitro activity of ceftazidime-avibactam
      and colistin against carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates
      and to obtain local antimicrobial surveillance data. A total of 150
      carbapenem-resistant K.pneumoniae isolates obtained from various clinical
      samples of the patients hospitalized in our hospital between 2018-2021
      were included in the study. Duplicate isolates were excluded from the
      study. The isolates were recovered from blood (n= 72), tracheal aspirate
      (n= 40), wound (n= 20), biopsy and abscess (n= 10), steril body fluid (n=
      5), and peripheral venous catheter (n= 3) samples. Isolates were
      identified by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight
      mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS, Bruker Daltonics, Germany). The minimum
      inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of the isolates for meropenem,
      colistin, ceftazidime, and ceftazidime-avibactam were determined by broth
      microdilution method. Susceptibility of the isolates to the tested
      antibiotics was evaluated by the European Committee of Antimicrobial
      Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) criteria. The presence of carbapenemases
      (VIM, IMP, NDM, KPC, and OXA-48) was investigated by polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR) using specific primers. The mcr-1, mcr-2, mcr-3, mcr-4, and
      mcr-5 genes were evaluated by PCR for plasmid-mediated colistin
      resistance. All K.pneumoniae isolates were found to be positive for at
      least one of the carbapenemase genes evaluated in the study. The blaOXA-48
      gene was detected in 107 (71.3%), blaKPC gene in 25 (16.7%); blaNDM gene
      in 7 (4.7%), co-production of blaOXA-48 and blaKPC genes in 10 (6.7%),
      co-production of blaOXA-48 and blaNDM genes in 1 (0.6%) isolate. None of
      the isolates harbored the blaVIM and blaIMP genes. None of the mcr genes
      screened in the study were detected among the isolates. The susceptibility
      of the isolates to ceftazidime-avibactam and colistin was 92.7% (139/150)
      and 48% (72/150), respectively. The MIC50 and MIC90 values for meropenem,
      ceftazidime, ceftazidime-avibactam, and colistin of the isolates were
      determined as 32/256, > 128/> 128, 1/8, and 4/16 µg/ml, respectively. Of
      the ceftazidimeavibactam resistant isolates, seven were positive for
      blaNDM, three for blaKPC, and one for both blaOXA-48 and blaNDM genes.
      High ceftazidime-avibactam MIC levels (> 128 µg/ml) were detected in
      metallo-betalactamase producing isolates. Consequently, our data suggested
      that ceftazidime-avibactam exhibited as a good alternative therapeutic
      choice for carbapenem-resistant K.pneumoniae isolates. It is noteworthy
      that high rate of colistin resistance was detected in K.pneumoniae
      isolates. Another notable finding of this study is the increase in
      K.pneumoniae isolates producing blaKPC for our country. To prevent the
      development of resistance which is observed even in last-choice
      therapeutic antibiotics, the principles of rational antibiotic use should
      be followed. The appropriate antimicrobial susceptibility testing should
      be routinely performed for surveillance of ceftazidime-avibactam and
      colistin.

AB  - The aim of this study was to investigate in vitro activity of
      imipenem-relebactam alone and in combination with fosfomycin against
      carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative pathogens. A total of 100 Gram-negative
      bacteria resistant to carbapenem were collected. Among collected 25
      carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, 24 (96%) were KPC
      producers and none of them displayed NDM-1, NDM-5, and IMP carbapenemase.
      Among 25 carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli strains, 3(12%), 1(4%),
      17(68%), 25(100%) and 20(80%) harbored KPC, NDM-1, NDM-5, ESBLs, and
      membrane porin OmpC or OmpF mutations, respectively. Among all the
      carbapenem-resistant strains, 40% (40/100) were resistant to
      imipenem-relebactam. The FICI revealed the synergistic (60%, 6/10) and
      additive (40%, 4/10) effects of imipenem-relebactam in combination with
      fosfomycin, wherein synergistic activity was found against all tested
      Klebsiella pneumoniae and Acinetobacter baumannii. Imipenem-relebactam may
      be a new alternative for carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative pathogens
      infections and the combination of imipenem-relebactam and fosfomycin
      warrants further exploration.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the health care setting, infection control actions are
      fundamental for containing the dissemination of multidrug-resistant
      bacteria (MDR). Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE), especially
      Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-KP), can spread among patients, although the
      dynamics of transmission are not fully known. Since CR-KP is present in
      wastewater and microorganisms are not completely removed from the toilet
      bowl by flushing, the risk of transmission in settings where toilets are
      shared should be addressed. We investigated whether urinating generates
      droplets that can be a vehicle for bacteria and explored the use of an
      innovative foam to control and eliminate this phenomenon. METHODS: To
      study droplet formation during urination, we set up an experiment in which
      different geometrical configurations of toilets could be reproduced and
      customized. To demonstrate that droplets can mobilize bacteria from the
      toilet bowl, a standard ceramic toilet was contaminated with a
      KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae ST101 isolate. Then, we reproduced
      urination and attached culture dishes to the bottom of the toilet lid for
      bacterial colony recovery with and without foam. RESULTS: Rebound droplets
      invariably formed, irrespective of the geometrical configuration of the
      toilet. In microbiological experiments, we demonstrated that bacteria are
      always mobilized from the toilet bowl (mean value: 0.11 ± 0.05 CFU/cm(2))
      and showed that a specific foam layer can completely suppress
      mobilization. CONCLUSIONS: Our study demonstrated that droplets generated
      from toilets during urination can be a hidden source of CR-KP transmission
      in settings where toilets are shared among colonized and noncolonized
      patients.

AB  - Boronic acids are known reversible covalent inhibitors of serine
      β-lactamases. The selectivity and high potency of specific boronates
      bearing an amide side chain that mimics the β-lactam's amide side chain
      have been advanced in several studies. Herein, we describe a new class of
      boronic acids in which the amide group is replaced by a bioisostere
      triazole. The boronic acids were obtained in a two-step synthesis that
      relies on the solid and versatile copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne
      cycloaddition (CuAAC) followed by boronate deprotection. All of the
      compounds show very good inhibition of the Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenemase KPC-2, with K(i) values ranging from 1 nM to 1 μM, and most
      of them are able to restore cefepime activity against K. pneumoniae
      harboring bla(KPC-2) . In particular, compound 1 e, bearing a sulfonamide
      substituted by a thiophene ring, proved to be an excellent KPC-2 inhibitor
      (K(i) =30 nM); it restored cefepime susceptibility in KPC-Kpn cells
      (MIC=0.5 μg/mL) with values similar to that of vaborbactam (K(i) =20 nM,
      MIC in KPC-Kpn 0.5 μg/mL). Our findings suggest that α-triazolylboronates
      might represent an effective scaffold for the treatment of KPC-mediated
      infections.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is an increasing problem in hospitals worldwide;
      however, the prevalence of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae
      (CPE) in our region is low. Burn patients are vulnerable to infection
      because of the loss of the protective skin barrier, thus burn centers
      prioritize infection prevention and control (IP&C). This report describes
      a CPE outbreak in a regional burn center. In a period of 2.5 months, four
      nosocomial cases of CPE were identified, three containing the Klebsiella
      pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) gene and one Verona integrin-encoded
      metallo-β-lactamase (VIM) gene. The first two cases were identified while
      there was no CPE patient source on the unit. CPE KPC gene was then
      isolated in sink drains of three rooms. In addition to rigorous IP&C
      practices already in place, we implemented additional outbreak measures
      including restricting admissions to patients with complex burns or burns
      ≥10% TBSA, admitting patients to other in-patient units, and not
      permitting elective admissions. We began cohorting patients using nursing
      team separation for CPE-positive and -negative patients and geographical
      separation on the unit. Despite aggressive IP&C measures already in place,
      hospital-acquired CPE colonization/infection occurred. Given that CPE
      contaminated sinks of the same enzyme were identified, we believe hospital
      sink drains may the source. This highlights the importance of sink design
      and engineering solutions to prevent the formation of biofilm and reduce
      splashing. CPE infections are associated with poor outcomes in patients
      and significant health system costs due to a longer length of stay and
      additional institutional resources.

AB  - The objective of this study is to characterize the molecular mechanism of
      a clinical carbapenem-resistant Citrobacter portucalensis strain K218,
      which coproduces KPC and NDM carbapenemases. K218 was isolated from a
      patient's blood sample in a Chinese tertiary hospital. Carbapenemases were
      detected by the immunocolloidal gold technique. The MIC values were
      determined by VITEK2. Whole-genome sequencing was performed on K218 and
      sequence data were analyzed using phylogenetics and extensive genomic
      comparison. This study reveals that K218 contains a single 5.08 Mb
      chromosome (51.8% GC content) and four plasmids, pK218-KPC (106 Kb),
      pK218-NDM (111 Kb), pK218-SHV (191 Kb), and pK218-NR (5 Kb). Twenty-nine
      types of antibiotic resistance genes were carried on K218, including
      bla(KPC-2) harbored on pK218-KPC and bla(NDM-1) harbored on pK218-NDM.
      Detailed comparison of related plasmids of pK218-KPC, pK218-NDM, and
      pK218-SHV showed that they shared similar conserved backbone regions,
      respectively. Comprehensive annotation revealed large accessory modules
      were recombined on the genome of K218. Further analysis speculated that
      mobile genetic elements bearing abundant resistance genes facilitated the
      formation of these accessory modules. In conclusion, this study provides
      an in-depth understanding of the genomic characterization of K218, an
      extensively drug-resistant C. portucalensis strain coproducing NDM and KPC
      carbapenemase. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of
      C. portucalensis strain coharboring bla(KPC-2) and bla(NDM-1) from the
      clinical setting. IMPORTANCE This is the first report of extensively
      drug-resistant C. portucalensis harboring both bla(KPC-2) and bla(NDM-1).
      This study will not only extend the understanding of the structural
      dissection of plasmids and chromosomes carried in C. portucalensis, but
      also expand knowledge of the genetic environment of the bla(KPC-2) and
      bla(NDM-1) genes. bla(KPC-2) and bla(NDM-1) genes have been suggested to
      facilitate the propagation and persistence of their host bacteria under
      different antimicrobial selection pressures. Large accessory regions
      carrying bla(KPC-2) and bla(NDM-1) genes have become hot spots for
      transposition and integration, and their structural variation and
      evolution should receive attention. The multidrug-resistant plasmids
      pK218-KPC, pK218-NDM, and pK218-SHV with several multidrug resistance
      regions and the chromosome cK218 with two novel transposons Tn7410 and
      Tn7411 contribute to the formation of extensively drug-resistant C.
      portucalensis.

AB  - Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative carriers of Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenemases (KPCs) often subvert antibiotic therapy due to inadequate
      sensitivity in laboratory detection. Although unstable gene amplification
      has been recognized to crucially contribute to underestimation or
      misestimation of antimicrobial resistance in clinical isolates, the
      precise mechanisms underlying carbapenem resistance driven by
      amplification of bla(KPC-2) remain obscure. Here, we reported that
      IS26-mediated amplification of bla(KPC-2) rapidly and robustly gave rise
      to carbapenem hyperresistant phenotypes in an Escherichia coli clinical
      strain following sublethal meropenem or tobramycin preexposure.
      Intriguingly, IS26 also underpinned amplification of a 47 kb multiple drug
      resistance (MDR) region encompassing nine antibiotic resistance genes and
      six IS26 insertion sequences. Tandem-repeat analysis and experimental
      validation demonstrated that bla(KPC-2) amplification was indeed mediated
      by IS26, which was further experimentally shown to involve intricate
      genetic rearrangement. Such gene amplification arose dynamically under
      antibiotic stress and subsided upon antibiotic withdrawal. Instead of
      reducing the amplification of the IS26-flanked MDR region, drug
      combinations in vitro exacerbated it. Our study, thus, provides valuable
      insights into how dynamic gene amplification processes can precipitously
      transform resistance status and complicate diagnosis. IMPORTANCE
      Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPCs) are powerful β-lactamases that
      enable Gram-negative pathogens to destroy clinically important carbapenems
      in antibiotic therapies. In particular, KPC-2 is difficult to detect due
      to a lack of instrument sensitivity in regular laboratory screens, which
      leads to misdiagnosis and poor treatment outcomes. It remains unclear how
      bla(KPC-2) rapidly induces exceedingly high-level resistance against
      carbapenems following the challenges of sublethal antibiotics. Here, we
      demonstrated that, under sublethal doses of antibiotics, insertion
      sequence IS26 mediated rapid amplification of multiple resistance
      determinants, including bla(KPC-2) and a multiple drug resistance (MDR)
      region, which was accompanied by intricate genetic rearrangement.

AB  - Cefepime/zidebactam is a β-lactam/β-lactam-enhancer based novel antibiotic
      which is in clinical development for treating infections caused by
      multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria. Here, in vitro activity of
      cefepime/zidebactam was determined against multicentre Klebsiella
      pneumoniae clinical isolates co-expressing serine and/or
      metallo-carbapenemases and defective OmpK35 and OmpK36 porins. The MICs
      were determined using the reference broth microdilution method. Outer
      membrane protein expression was assessed using SDS-PAGE and mutations in
      the genes encoding OmpK35 and OmpK36 were identified by DNA sequencing.
      Among 34 isolates studied, carbapenemase genes, bla(KPC) and
      bla(OXA-48-like), were present in 18 and 11 isolates, respectively; 5
      isolates harboured both bla(OXA-48-like) and bla(NDM). Point mutations,
      insertions, and duplications in OmpK35 and OmpK36, which are known to
      impact the activity of carbapenems, were detected. Against these isolates,
      cefepime/zidebactam (1:1) showed a consistent activity (MICs ≤4 mg/L). In
      conclusion, cefepime/zidebactam overcomes enzymatic, and non-enzymatic
      carbapenem-impacting resistance mechanisms concurrently expressed in K.

AB  - The aim of this study was to determine the contribution of the
      contamination of the health care environment in the acquisition of
      carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) in a CRKP-prevalent
      setting. We performed a 3-month prospective study in a 20-bed medical
      intensive care unit (ICU) by collecting rectal/oral swabs from patients
      within 3 days of ICU admission and weekly thereafter. We also
      comprehensively sampled the beds and rooms of patients and instruments for
      patient care every week. CRKP were detected, genome sequenced, and
      assigned to clones based on core genome analyses. The survival of four
      CRKP clones was determined under ICU conditions. Seventeen patients were
      in the ICU at the start of the study, and 99 were admitted afterwards. Six
      were positive patients, with four detected on initial screening and two
      during weekly monitoring. CRKP was detected from 76 of 3,699 (2.1%)
      environment samples, including from the immediate surroundings of 21
      patients (five had CRKP from clinical samples and 16 did not). CRKP was
      not detected outside patient care areas. Among 49 CRKP sequenced isolates
      (nine from swabs, five from clinical samples, and 35 from environment)
      from 21 patients, 45 were ST11 and had bla(KPC-2). These could be assigned
      to four clones, with either KL47 (n = 22) or KL64 (n = 23) capsular type.
      The two dominant clones survived >30 days under ICU conditions. In
      conclusion, environmental contamination of CRKP was extensive but usually
      transient. It had little impact on CRKP acquisition by ICU patients,
      highlighting the ability to control CRKP transmission through infection
      prevention efforts even in high-prevalence settings. IMPORTANCE Klebsiella
      pneumoniae can be an opportunistic pathogen with the oral cavity and gut
      the main origin. However, carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae
      (CRKP) can be found in patient surroundings and is a serious threat for
      human infections. Although the hospital environment, particularly sinks,
      has long been considered a potential reservoir of CRKP, the exact role of
      environmental contamination contributing to the acquisition and
      transmission of CRKP among patients remains largely unknown. To understand
      the link between environmental contamination in health care settings and
      colonization and infection of patients by CRKP, we performed a 3-month
      prospective study in a 20-bed medical ICU. Isolates were collected by
      active patient screening and were subsequently genome sequenced to
      describe the diversity of CRKP and the linkage of patients and
      environmental reservoirs. We found that the environmental contamination of
      CRKP was extensive, and CRKP clones were freely circulating in the ICU.
      Environmental contamination was not due to sharing the bed unit or sharing
      contaminated instruments but more likely resulted from the movement of
      health care workers. Very few patients acquired CRKP in the ICU, which is
      likely due to the fact that environmental contamination was usually
      transient when a routine cleaning protocol was complied. Although CRKP
      contamination in patient surroundings may be extensive, as long as routine
      environment cleaning protocols are appropriate and well implemented, the
      health care environment is unlikely to be a major source of CRKP
      colonization and infection in ICU patients. Reducing the high workload for
      ICU nurses may help minimize CRKP environmental contamination.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergence of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae
      (CPE) represents a major clinical problem. Recently, the occurrence of CPE
      has increased globally, but epidemiological patterns vary across region.
      We report the trends in the genotypic distribution and antimicrobial
      susceptibility of CPE isolated from rectal and clinical samples during a
      four-year period. METHODS: Between January 2016 and December 2019, 1,254
      nonduplicated CPE isolates were obtained from four university hospitals in
      Korea. Carbapenemase genotypes were determined by multiplex real-time PCR.
      Antimicrobial susceptibility was profiled using the Vitek 2 system
      (bioMérieux, Hazelwood, MO, USA) or MicroScan Walkaway-96 system (Siemens
      West Sacramento, CA, USA). The proportions of carbapenemase genotypes and
      nonsusceptibility were analyzed using Pearson's chi-square test. RESULTS:
      Among the 1,254 CPE isolates, 486 (38.8%), 371 (29.6%), 357 (28.5%), 8
      (0.6%), 8 (0.6%), and 24 (1.9%) were Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase
      (KPC), oxacillinase (OXA)-48-like, New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM),
      imipenemase (IMP), Verona integron-encoded metallo-β-lactamase (VIM), and
      multiple producers, respectively. The predominant species was K.
      pneumoniae (72.6%), followed by Escherichia coli (6.5%). More than 90% of
      the isolates harboring KPC, NDM, and OXA-48-like were nonsusceptible to
      cephalosporins, aztreonam, and carbapenems. CONCLUSIONS: The impact of CPE
      is primarily due to KPC-, NDM-, and OXA-48-like-producing K. pneumoniae
      isolates. Isolates carrying these carbapenemase are mostly
      multidrug-resistant. Control strategies based on these genotypic
      distributions and antimicrobial susceptibilities of CPE isolates are
      required.

      carbapenemic-resistant genes in multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae
      strains isolated at the Instituto Materno Perinatal de Lima (2015-2018).
      Susceptibility levels were analyzed by disk diffusion and microdilution.
      The presence of colistin- and carbapenemic-resistant genes was determined
      by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and was related to clonality. A total
      of 36 K. pneumoniae strains were analyzed, 5 (13.8%) were resistant to
      colistin and belonged to different clonal groups. Only 2 strains were
      found with carbapenemases (bla KPC and bla NDM), and no colistin plasmid
      genes were detected. High resistance levels to the other tested
      antimicrobials were observed, except for amikacin (13.9%). The results
      highlight the presence of colistin-resistant strains (33.3% in 2018), a
      worrying situation as they are part of the latest treatment alternatives
      for infections caused by multiresistant pathogens.

AB  - Ceftazidime-avibactam is used clinically in combination with a polymyxin
      for the treatment of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative infections;
      however, there are limited data to support this practice. The objective of
      this study was to evaluate the activity of ceftazidime-avibactam and
      polymyxin B alone and in combination against Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in a tandem in vitro
      time-kill/in vivo Galleria mellonella survival model assay. Three
      KPC-3-producing K. pneumoniae clinical isolates were used for all
      experiments. All isolates harbored mutations in ompk35 and one isolate in
      ompk36; two isolates were susceptible to both ceftazidime-avibactam and
      polymyxin B, and one was resistant to both. Ceftazidime-avibactam was
      bactericidal against 2 of 3 strains at ≥2x minimum inhibitory
      concentration (MIC) whereas polymyxin B was not bactericidal against any
      strain at any concentration. Combinations at 1/4x or 1/2x MIC were not
      bactericidal or synergistic against any of the 3 isolates. In survival
      experiments, ceftazidime-avibactam at 4x MIC significantly improved larval
      survival over the untreated control strain whereas polymyxin B at 4x MIC
      did not. Combining polymyxin B with ceftazidime-avibactam at 4x MIC did
      not improve survival compared to ceftazidime-avibactam alone. This work
      indicates there is no improvement in in vitro bactericidal activity or in
      vivo efficacy when polymyxin B is combined with ceftazidime-avibactam
      against KPC-producing K. pneumoniae. This combination should be avoided in
      lieu of ceftazidime-avibactam alone or other potentially more efficacious,
      less toxic combination regimens.

AB  - The present study evaluated the carbapenem resistance mechanisms of
      Klebsiella pneumoniae strains isolated in two Greek tertiary teaching
      hospitals and their susceptibility to currently used and novel
      antimicrobial agents.Forty-seven carbapenem resistant K. pneumoniae
      strains were collected in G. Papanikolaou and Ippokrateio hospital of
      Thessaloniki between 2016 and 2018. Strain identification and
      antimicrobial susceptibility was conducted by Vitek 2 system (Biomérieux
      France). Susceptibility against new antimicrobial agents was examined by
      disk diffusion method. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to detect
      blaKPC, blaVIM, blaNDM and blaOXA-48 genes.The meropenem-EDTA and
      meropenem-boronic acid synergy test performed on the 24 K. pneumoniae
      strains demonstrated that 8 (33.3%) yielded positive for
      metallo-beta-lactamases (MBL) and 16 (66.6%) for K. pneumonia
      carbapenemases (KPC) production. Colistin demonstrated the highest in
      vitro activity (87.7%) among the 47 K. pneumoniae strains followed by
      gentamicin (76.5%) and tigecycline (51%). Among new antibiotics
      ceftazidime/avibactam showed the highest sensitivity (76.6%) in all
      strains followed by eravacycline (66.6%). The blaKPC gene was present in
      30 strains (63.8%), the blaNDM in 11 (23.4%) and the blaVIM in 6 (12.8%).
      The blaOXA-48 gene was not detected.Well established antimicrobial agents
      such as colistin, gentamicin and tigecycline and novel antibiotics like
      ceftazidime/avibactam and eravacycline can be reliable options for the
      treatment of invasive infections caused by carbapenem-resistant K.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To identify the carbapenemase and colistin resistance genes
      and epidemiological status of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE)
      among 7 secondary and 11 tertiary hospitals in Henan province, China.
      METHODS: CRE isolates and clinical data of infected patients were
      collected from 7 secondary and 11 tertiary hospitals in Henan from July to
      September 2019 and analysed retrospectively. Polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR) and gene sequencing were performed to detect carbapenemase and
      colistin resistance genes; multilocus sequence typing was also performed.
      RESULTS: In total, 238 nonduplicate CRE isolates were collected mainly
      from the respiratory tract (54.20%) and blood (18.91%) of CRE-infected
      patients, half of them aged >65 years (45.80%). Carbapenem-resistant
      Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) was the most common CRE (184 isolates,
      77.31%) with constituent ratios of 84.38% and 72.54% in secondary and
      tertiary hospitals, respectively. In 184 CRKP isolates, bla(KPC-2)
      (89.13%) was the dominant carbapenemase gene, and ST11 (71.74%) was the
      most prevalent sequence type (ST), with constituent ratios of 83.95% and
      62.14% in secondary and tertiary hospitals, respectively. In 29
      carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli (CREC) isolates, bla(NDM-5) (58.62%)
      and ST2 (31.03%) were prevalent. Four CRKP isolates and one CREC isolate
      were colistin-resistant and carried the plasmid-mediated mcr-1 gene.
      CONCLUSION: Our results showed a wide spread of CRKP-ST11 with KPC-2
      carbapenemase in the analysed 18 hospitals. The CRKP constituent ratio,
      CRKP-STs, and CREC carbapenemase genes between secondary and tertiary
      hospitals showed significant differences. The emergence of a
      colistin-resistant CRKP with plasmid-mediated resistance gene mcr-1 is of
      serious concern due to the limited treatment options.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the incidence and the molecular mechanisms
      of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in patients from the Sétif
      University Hospital, Algeria. Nonduplicate clinical bacterial isolates
      recovered from patients attending the University Hospital of Sétif were
      collected between April and October 2018. Species identification was
      performed by MALDI-TOF/MS (matrix-assisted laser desorption
      ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry) method. The susceptibility of
      the isolates to carbapenems was determined using the disc diffusion
      method. The carbapenem resistant isolates were screened for the presence
      of common carbapenemase genes (bla(KPC), bla(OXA-48), bla(VIM), bla(IMP),
      and bla(NDM)) and extended-spectrum β-lactamase (bla(CTX), bla(TEM), and
      bla(SHV)) using PCR and sequencing technique. A total of 123 nonrepetitive
      Enterobacteriaceae isolates were obtained. Klebsiella pneumoniae (n =
      52/42.28%), Escherichia coli (n = 24/19.51%), and Enterobacter cloacae (n
      = 19/15.45%) were the most prevalent species. The Carba-NP test showed
      that 6 out of 123 isolates carried carbapenemase enzymes. OXA-48 was found
      in five isolates (four K. pneumoniae and one E. coli) and NDM-5 in one E.
      cloacae isolate. We reported for the first time in Algeria the presence of
      NDM-5 carbapenemase enzyme in a clinical E. cloacae isolate.

AB  - Nosocomial infections caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Klebsiella
      pneumoniae are a major health problem worldwide. The aim of this study was
      to describe NDM-1-producing K. pneumoniae strains causing bacteremia in a
      tertiary referral hospital in Mexico. MDR K. pneumoniae isolates were
      screened by polymerase chain reaction for the presence of resistance
      genes. In resistant isolates, plasmids were identified and conjugation
      assays were performed. Clonal diversity and the sequence types were
      determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence
      typing. A total of 80 K. pneumoniae isolates were collected from patients
      with bacteremia over a 1-year period. These isolates showed a level of
      resistance of 59% (47/80) to aztreonam, 56-60% (45-48/80) to
      cephalosporins, 54% (43/80) to colistin and 12.5% (10/80) to carbapenems.
      The carbapenem resistant isolates were bla (NDM-) (1) carriers and
      negative for bla (KPC), bla (NDM), bla (IMP), bla (VIM) and bla (OXA-)
      (48) (-like) carbapenemases genes. Conjugative plasmids IncFIIA and IncF
      group with sizes of 82-195 kbp were carriers of bla (NDM-) (1), bla
      (CTX-M-) (15), bla (TEM-) (1), aac(6')-Ib and/or aac(3')-IIa. Clonal
      variability and nine different multilocus sequence types were detected
      (ST661, ST683, ST1395, ST2706, ST252, ST1198, ST690, ST1535, and ST3368)
      for the first time in the isolates carrying bla (NDM-) (1) in Mexico. This
      study demonstrates that bla (NDM-) (1) has remained within this hospital
      in recent years and suggests that it is currently the most prevalent
      carbapenemase among K. pneumoniae MDR strains causing bacteremia in
      Mexico. The horizontal transfer of bla (NDM-) (1) gene through IncF-like
      plasmids among different clones demonstrates the dissemination pathway of
      antimicrobial resistance and underscore the need for strong and urgent
      joint measures to control the spread of NDM-1 carbapenemase in the
      hospital.

AB  - Carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA) has been a major threat
      to human health due to its increased morbidity and mortality in clinical
      settings. Carbapenemase genes are less frequently found in CRPA compared
      with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, of which carbapenemase
      producers are common. In this study, we identified 11
      bla(KPC-2)-harbouring P. aeruginosa isolates from 139
      carbapenemase-insensitive P. aeruginosa isolates collected between 2010
      and 2021 in a tertiary hospital in China. Nine isolates belonged to ST697,
      while the other two were ST463. The antibiotic susceptibility testing
      showed that all the isolates were multidrug resistant, including
      resistance to imipenem, meropenem, ceftazidime, and tigecycline. Patients
      with Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-2 (KPC-2)-producing P. aeruginosa
      infections were mostly associated with complicated diseases and prolonged
      hospital stay, with 30% deterioration. The whole-genome sequencing
      analysis showed that these isolates carried multiple antibiotic resistance
      genes and virulence genes, and the KPC-2 genetic elements were highly
      related in ST697 isolates. The complete sequencing of ST697 isolate SE5416
      showed that the harbouring of bla(KPC-2) resulted from complex
      transposition and homologous recombination of an Inc(pRBL16) plasmid and
      other mobile elements. The Galleria mellonella infection model experiment
      showed that these KPC-2-producing P. aeruginosa-infected larvae had low
      survival rates and high virulence. The present study revealed the shifting
      of CRPA from ST697 to ST463 in East China; ST463 had higher drug
      resistance, posing greater challenges for clinical management.

AB  - During 2014-2016, a total of 248 carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella
      pneumoniae (CARB-R Kp) were recovered in a Greek intensive care unit
      (ICU), the colistin resistance (COL-R) rates among CARB-R Kp from
      bloodstream infections (BSIs) were determined, and molecular
      characterization and the in vitro susceptibility of CARB-R+COL-R Kp to
      ceftazidime/avibactam were performed. The majority of CARB-R Kp from BSIs
      (n = 53) were OXA-48 (43.4%) and KPC (33.9%) producers, but no
      statistically significant differences were observed for the clinical
      characteristics of ICU patients affected by OXA-48 and other
      carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae. CARB-R+COL-R Kp (n = 28)
      represented 52.8% of 53 CARB-R Kp recovered from BSIs. The increase in the
      COL-R rates from 2014 to 2015 was mainly associated with the diffusion of
      extensively drug-resistant (XDR) OXA-48-co-producing CTX-M-15-like K.
      pneumoniae, assigned to multilocus-sequence typing ST101, possessing
      alterations in the mgrB loci. Ceftazidime/avibactam was active against all
      OXA-48 and KPC producers. Thus, the spread of XDR Kp possessing different
      types of carbapenemases further complicates the infection control
      strategies for the management of XDR Kp, whereas ceftazidime/avibactam may
      be a reasonable alternative to colistin for the treatment of XDR Kp in
      settings with low prevalence of metallo-β lactamase-producing K.

AB  - Ceftolozane-tazobactam (C/T) is frequently used for infections caused by
      multidrug-resistant (MDR)-Enterobacterales isolates. Whole-genome
      sequencing (WGS, Illumina-Hiseq 4000/NovaSeq 6000, OGC, UK) was used to
      study the population structure, the resistome and the virulome of
      C/T-susceptible and -resistant MDR Escherichia spp. (n=30) and Klebsiella
      spp. (n=78) isolates, recovered from lower respiratory, intra-abdominal
      and urinary tract infections of ICU patients from 11 Portuguese Hospitals
      (STEP study, 2017-2018). Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were
      determined (ISO-broth microdilution, breakpoints EUCAST-2020). In
      Escherichia spp., a weak concordance between the phenotypic and the WGS
      method (P=0.051) was observed in the carbapenemase detection (3/30)
      [bla(VIM-2) (2/3), bla(KPC-3) (1/3)]; VIM-2-Escherichia coli isolates were
      C/T-susceptible and only the KPC-3-Escherichia marmotae producer showed
      C/T-resistance. Overall, CTX-M-15-E. coli-ST131-O25:H4-H30-Rx (11/30) was
      the most frequent subclone, followed by CTX-M-27-E. coli-ST131-O25:H4-H30
      (4/4). Moreover, a wide resistome and virulome were detected in all E.
      coli isolates. Among Klebsiella spp. isolates [K. pneumoniae (67/78), K.
      aerogenes (7/78), K. oxytoca (2/78), K. variicola (2/78)], concordance
      (P<0.001) was observed between the phenotypic and the genomic
      carbapenemase detection (21/78) [bla(KPC-3) (14/21), bla(OXA-48) (3/21),
      bla(OXA-181) (3/21)]. A high correlation between C/T-resistance and
      carbapenemase detection was established (P<0.05). Overall, a high clonal
      diversity was observed, mainly in KPC-3-producing K. pneumoniae isolates.
      An extensive resistome was detected in Klebsiella spp. isolates, whereas
      virulence determinants were mostly identified in carbapenemase producers
      (P<0.001). WGS is a powerful tool for typing characterization and
      microbiological study of MDR-Enterobacterales pathogens. Furthermore,
      carbapenemase genes are associated with C/T-resistance in Klebsiella spp.,
      but other mechanisms might also be involved.

AB  - Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) pose an increasing threat
      to patient safety and healthcare systems globally. We present molecular
      epidemiology of CPE in Finland during 2012-2018 with detailed
      characteristics of CPE strains causing clusters during the same time
      period. All Finnish clinical microbiology laboratories send
      Enterobacterales isolates with reduced susceptibility to carbapenems or
      isolates producing carbapenemase to the reference laboratory for further
      characterization by whole genome sequencing (WGS). In total, 231 CPE
      strains from 202 patients were identified during 2012-2018. Of the
      strains, 59% were found by screening and 32% from clinical specimens, the
      latter were most commonly urine. Travel and/or hospitalization history
      abroad was reported for 108/171 strains (63%). The most common species
      were Klebsiella pneumoniae (45%), Escherichia coli (40%), and Citrobacter
      freundii (6%), and the most common carbapenemase genes bla(NDM-like)
      (35%), bla(OXA-48-like) (33%), and bla(KPC-like) (31%). During 2012-2018,
      the annual number of CPE strains increased from 9 to 70 and different
      sequence types from 7 to 33, and bla(OXA-48-like) genes became the most
      prevalent. Of the clusters, 3/8 were linked to traveling or
      hospitalization abroad and 5/8 were caused by K. pneumoniae clone clonal
      complex 258. Most of the clusters were caused by K. pneumoniae producing
      KPC. High variety among different sequence types indicates that majority
      of CPE cases detected in Finland are likely imported from foreign
      countries. Nearly one-third of the cases are not found by screening
      suggesting that there is hidden transmission occurring in the healthcare
      settings.

AB  - The gastrointestinal tract is an important reservoir of high-risk
      Enterobacteria clones and a driver of antimicrobial resistance in
      hospitals. In this study, patients from six hospitals in four major
      Bulgarian towns were included in this study. Overall, 205
      cefotaxime-resistant isolates (35.3%) of Enterobacterales order were
      detected in fecal samples among 580 patients during the period of
      2017-2019. ESBL/carbapenemase/plasmidic AmpC producer rates were 28.8%,
      2.4%, and 1.2%, respectively. A wide variety of ESBLs: CTX-M-15 (41%),
      CTX-M-3 (24%), CTX-M-27 (11%), and CTX-M-14 (4%) was found. The
      carbapenemases identified in this study were New Delhi metalo-β-lactamase
      (NDM)-1 (5.4%) and Klebsiella carbapenemase (KPC)-2 (1.5%). Most NDM-1
      isolates also produced CTX-M-15/-3 and CMY-4 β-lactamases. They belonged
      to ST11 Klebsiella pneumoniae clone. The epidemiology typing revealed
      three main high-risk K. pneumoniae clones (26%)-ST11, ST258, and ST15 and
      five main Escherichia coli clones-ST131 (41.7%), ST38, ST95, ST405, and
      ST69. Sixty-one percent of ST131 isolates were from the highly virulent
      epidemic clone O25b:H4-ST131. Phylotyping revealed that 69% of E. coli
      isolates belonged to the virulent B2 and D groups. Almost all (15/16)
      Enterobacter isolates were identified as E. hormaechei and the most common
      ST type was ST90. Among all of the isolates, a high
      ESBL/carbapenemases/plasmid AmpC (32.4%) prevalence was observed. A
      significant proportion of the isolates (37%) were members of high-risk
      clones including two pan-drug-resistant K. pneumoniae ST11 NDM-1 producing
      isolates. Due to extensive antibiotic usage during COVID-19, the situation
      may worsen, so routine screenings and strict infection control measures
      should be widely implemented.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bacteria prevalent in the hospital environment have developed
      multi-drug resistance (MDR), such as the carbapenemase-producing
      Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC(+)). Photodynamic therapy (PDT), which uses
      light-activated photosensitizer compounds (PSs), has emerged as an
      alternative to antibiotics. Cationic-PSs have a better bactericidal effect
      by interacting more closely with the bacterial envelope. METHODS: Two PSs
      based on cationic Ir (III) compounds (PSIR-1 and PSIR-2) were studied in
      photodynamic therapy against KPC(+) and KPC(-) bacteria, and their PDT
      activities were compared with a cationic Ru(II) control compound (PS -Ru).
      RESULTS: Similar to the behavior of PS-Ru control, the cytotoxicity of
      PSIR-1 and 2, showing a bacterial inhibition growth of more than 3log(10)
      (>99.9 % inactivation), at light fluency of 17 μW/cm(2). The minimal dose
      to accomplish the inhibition in 3log(10) was determined for PSIR-1 and
      PSIR-2 at 4 and 2 μg/mL, respectively and the lethality was 30 min of
      light exposure for both compounds. Notably, the PSIR-1 and 2 compounds
      showed a synergistic effect with imipenem by significantly increasing (up
      to 6 log(10)) the photodynamic bactericidal effect for KPC(+) strains.
      This synergy is specific for PSIR-1 and 2 compounds, since it was not
      observed with the PS-Ru control. On normal gastric cells GES-1, both
      PSIR-1 and 2 showed significant cytotoxicity; however, the highest
      cytotoxicity was found in gastric tumor cells (AGS). CONCLUSION: The
      compounds PSIR-1 and 2 are bactericidal photosensitizers and represent a
      promising alternative for complementing the treatment of infections by MDR
      bacteria since they should not be toxic in the dark.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Pneumonia caused by carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae
      (CRKP) is associated with high mortality. However, clinical studies on
      CRKP infections often exclusively involve bacteraemia, with only a few
      studies having focused on pneumonia. This retrospective study was
      conducted to investigate the clinical and microbiological characteristics
      of pneumonia caused by CRKP. METHODS: Adult patients diagnosed with CRKP
      monomicrobial pneumonia treated with at least one active antimicrobial
      agent within 5 days of the pneumonia diagnosis were identified in a
      medical centre in Taiwan between January 2017 and April 2019. Clinical
      characteristics and outcomes of these patients were determined. Resistance
      mechanisms and capsular types of the CRKP isolates were determined by PCR.
      RESULTS: A total of 56 patients with CRKP monomicrobial pneumonia were
      identified. The 7-day and 14-day mortality rates were 7.1% and 23.2%,
      respectively. Malignancy [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 8.87, 95% confidence
      interval (CI) 1.66-47.26; P = 0.011] and Acute Physiology and Chronic
      Health Evaluation (APACHE) II score (aOR = 1.12, 95% CI 1-1.25; P = 0.048)
      were independently associated with 14-day mortality. Most CRKP clinical
      isolates were carbapenemase-producers (39/44; 88.6%), of which K.
      pneumoniae carbapenemase type 2 (KPC-2)-producing isolates were most
      prevalent (30/39; 76.9%). The most prevalent capsular type in these
      isolates was K47 (30/44; 68.2%). CONCLUSION: CRKP pneumonia is associated
      with high 14-day mortality. Malignancy and APACHE II score were
      independently associated with 14-day mortality.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To clarify the distribution and composition of drug-resistant
      genes of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) in Qingdao City
      and to provide rationale for clinical application of antibacterial
      treatment by screening for carbapenemase phenotype and detecting
      resistance genes of CRKP. METHODS: Fifty-four clinically isolated
      non-repeating CRKP from five Third Grade and Class A Hospitals in Qingdao
      City from October 2016 to September 2019 were collected. Kirby-Bauer
      method was used for drug sensitivity tests of commonly used antibacterial
      drugs; modified Hodge test was used for carbapenemase phenotypic
      screening; and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to amplify
      bla(KPC-2), bla(NDM-1), bla(OXA-48), bla(IMP), bla(VIM) target genes. The
      amplified products were subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis. RESULTS:
      Drug susceptibility tests showed that CRKP had the lowest resistance rate
      to amikacin (35.2%), followed by compound sinomine (53.7%), gentamicin
      (55.6%), levofloxacin (75.9%), and imipenem-cilastatin (88.9%);
      piperacillin-tazobactam, meropenem, cefotaxime, and cefoperazone-sulbactam
      were all higher than 90%. There were 43 positive strains in the modified
      Hodge test (the positive rate was 79.63%) and 11 negative strains. A total
      of 40 strains with carbapenemase resistance were detected by PCR
      resistance gene detection. The detection rate of target drug-resistant
      genes was 74.07%. Among them, 35 strains carry the KPC-2 gene, 7 strains
      carry the OXA-48 gene, 4 strains carry the NDM-1 gene, and 1 strain
      carries the IMP gene. All strains carrying the OXA-48 gene also carried
      the KPC-2 gene, which was not detected. Strains carrying the VIM gene were
      identified, and the remaining 14 strains did not detect the target
      carbapenem gene. CONCLUSIONS: The carbapenem-producing genes carried by
      CRKP in five hospitals in Qingdao City are mainly KPC-2, followed by
      OXA-48 and NDM-1.

AB  - The spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) K. pneumoniae
      carbapenemase-producing bacteria (KPC) is one of the most serious threats
      to global public health. Due to the limited antibiotic options, colis- tin
      often represents a therapeutic choice. In this study, we performed
      Whole-Genome Sequencing (WGS) by Illumina and Nanopore platforms on four
      colistin-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates (CoRKp) to explore the
      resistance profile and the mutations involved in colistin resistance.
      Mapping reads with reference sequence of the most com- mon genes involved
      in colistin resistance did not show the presence of mobile colistin
      resistance (mcr) genes in all CoRKp. Complete or partial deletions of mgrB
      gene were observed in three out of four CoRKp, while in one CoRKp the
      mutation V24G on phoQ was identified. Complementation assay with proper
      wild type genes restored colistin susceptibility, validating the role of
      the amino acid substitution V24G and, as already described in the
      literature, confirming the key role of mgrB alterations in colistin
      resistance. In conclusion, this study allowed the identification of the
      novel mutation on phoQ gene involved in colistin resistance phenotype.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance profiling of pathogens helps to identify the
      emergence of rare or new resistance threats and prioritize possible
      actions to be taken against them. The analysis of wastewater (WW) can
      reveal the circulation of antimicrobial-resistant bacteria (ARB) and
      antimicrobial resistance genes (ARG) among the catchment communities.
      Here, we analyzed WW influent samples to determine the prevalence of
      carbapenemase genes-carrying Gram-negative bacteria (Carba-GNB) in
      Helsinki, Finland. This study set important historical reference points
      from the very early stage of the carbapenemase era, during the period
      2011-2012. A total of 405 bacterial isolates grown on CHROMagarKPC (n =
      195) and CHROMagarESBL (n = 210) from WW influent samples were collected
      between October 2011 and August 2012 and were analyzed. The bacterial DNA
      from the isolates was extracted, and the prevalence of carbapenemases
      genes bla (KPC), bla (NDM), bla (GES), bla (OXA-48), bla (IMP), bla (IMI),
      and bla (VIM) were screened with multiplexed PCR. All
      carbapenemase-positive isolates were identified taxonomically to species
      or genus level with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of
      flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). The nucleic acid extraction was
      successful for 399 isolates, of which 59 (14.8%) were found to carry
      carbapenemase genes. A total of 89.8% of the carbapenemase positive
      isolates (53 out of 59) were obtained from CHROMagarKPC plates and only
      10.2% (six out of 59) were obtained from CHROMagar ESBL plates. Among the
      Carba-GNB isolates, 86.4% were bla (GES) (51 out of 59), 10.2% were bla
      (KPC) (six out of 59), and 3.4% were bla (VIM) (two out of 59). The most
      common carba-gene, bla (GES), was carried by 10 different bacterial
      species, including Aeromonas spp., Enterobacter spp., and Kluyvera spp.;
      the bla (KPC) gene was carried by Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae,
      and Kluyvera cryocescens; and the bla (VIM) gene was carried by Aeromonas
      hydrophila/caviae and Citrobacter amalonaticus. This study emphasizes that
      wastewater surveillance (WWS) can be an additional tool for monitoring
      antimicrobial resistance (AMR) at the population level.

AB  - New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM) had been reported to be the
      predominant carbapenemase among Escherichia coli in Taiwan. However,
      studies focusing on the clonal background and epidemiology of plasmids
      carrying NDM genes were limited. Between 2016 and 2018, all clinical E.
      coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates that were non-susceptible to
      ertapenem, meropenem, and imipenem were tested for carbapenemase-encoding
      genes (CEGs) and antimicrobial susceptibilities. Molecular typing was
      performed on all carbapenemase-producing isolates. Whole genome sequencing
      (WGS) was performed on all NDM-positive E. coli isolates. Twenty-three
      (29.5%) of 78 carbapenem non-susceptible E. coli and 108 (35.3%) of 306
      carbapenem non-susceptible K. pneumoniae isolates carried CEGs. The most
      prevalent CEGs in carbapenemase-producing E. coli (CPEc) were bla(NDM)
      (39.1%) and bla(IMP-8) (30.4%), while that in carbapenemase-producing K.
      pneumoniae was Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) (72.2%). Fifteen
      sequence types were identified among 23 CPEc, and 55.6% of NDM-positive E.
      coli isolates belonged to ST410. WGS showed ST410 isolates were highly
      clonal and similar to those from other countries. All NDM-5-positive E.
      coli isolates carried identical IncX3 plasmid harboring bla(NDM-5) but no
      other antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes. In each of the four
      NDM-1-positive E. coli isolates, the bla(NDM-1) was present in a ∼ 300 kb
      IncHI2/IncHI2A plasmid which carried an array of AMR genes. NDMs are the
      most prevalent carbapenemase among CPEc in Taiwan. Awareness should be
      raised as the prevalence of NDM-positive E. coli might increase rapidly
      with IncX3 plasmid and globally distributed strain ST410 being the
      potential vectors for wide dissemination.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) represent a
      serious threat to public health. Clinical microbiology laboratories (CMLs)
      need effective protocols for screening and confirmation of CPE. AIM: To
      prospectively evaluate an algorithm for the screening of
      carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in an OXA-48 endemic
      hospital. METHODS: The algorithm was based on a disc diffusion assay using
      ertapenem and temocillin, which also served as a purity check for routine
      automated antimicrobial susceptibility testing. All isolates with minimal
      inhibitory concentrations >0.5 mg/L or zone inhibition diameters <25 mm
      for ertapenem (Criterion 1) and <12 mm for temocillin (Criterion 2) were
      tested sequentially by an OXA-48 lateral flow immunochromatographic assay
      and a multiplex polymerase chain reaction targeting VIM, KPC and OXA-48.
      If neither test was positive, the modified Hodge test or CARBA NP test was
      used. FINDINGS: Over 2 years, 2487 K. pneumoniae were assessed by the
      algorithm proposed, and 378 (15.20%) met both criteria. Of these, 98.68%
      (373/378) were either confirmed as OXA-48 producers or originated from
      patients with a previous CPE isolate that maintained the same resistance
      phenotype over time. The remaining three K. pneumoniae were VIM producers.
      Only two of the 378 isolates (0.53%) did not produce carbapenemase,
      despite meeting Criteria 1 and 2. CONCLUSION: The algorithm described
      combined the most sensitive carbapenem for CPE detection with a cut-off
      for temocillin that was highly specific for detection of OXA-48. It is
      reliable and easy to apply in routine CML work flow, allowing rapid
      detection of CPE isolates and hence prompt implementation of infection
      control measures and targeted antimicrobial regimens.

AB  - ABSTRACTKlebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing
      Enterobacterales are prevalent worldwide and pose an alarming threat to
      public health. The incidence and transmission of bla(KPC-2) gene via
      horizontal gene transfer (e.g. transposition) have been well documented.
      However, the dynamics of transposon structure bearing bla(KPC-2) and their
      exact effects on the evolution and dissemination of bla(KPC-2) gene are
      not well characterized. Here, we collected all 161 carbapenem-resistant
      Enterobacterales (CRE) isolates during the early stage of CRE pandemic. We
      observed that the prevalence of KPC-2-producing Enterobacterales was
      mediated by multiple species and sequence types (STs), and that bla(KPC-2)
      gene was located on three diverse variants of Tn1721 in multi-drug
      resistance (MDR) region of plasmid. Notably, the outbreak of
      KPC-2-producing plasmid is correlated with the dynamics of transposon
      structure. Furthermore, we experimentally demonstrated that replicative
      transposition of Tn1721 and IS26 promotes horizontal transfer of
      bla(KPC-2) and the evolution of KPC-2-producing plasmid. The Tn1721
      variants appearing concurrently with the peak of an epidemic (A2- and
      B-type) showed higher transposition frequencies and a certain superior
      ability to propagation. Overall, our work suggests replicative
      transposition contributes to the evolution and transmission of
      KPC-2-producing plasmid and highlights its important role in the inter-
      and intra-species dissemination of bla(KPC-2) gene in Enterobacterales.

      Serratia marcescens (6%) and other members of Enterobacterales (6%), also
      gram-negative non-glucose-fermenting bacteria Acinetobacter baumannii
      (14%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (36%) were found among selected strains.
      Carbapenemase production was found in 385 isolates (77%). The main
      mechanism determining carbapenem resistance in P. aeruginosa was the
      production of blaVIM (100%). A. baumanii strains harbored OXA-23 (55%) and
      OXA-40 (45%) carbapenemases. The major determinant of carbapenem
      resistance in K. pneumoniae isolates was OXA-48 carbapenemase, detected in
      63% strains, 13% of the strains possessed blaNDM-group, 16% isolates had a
      combination of blaNDM-group and blaOXA-48-like. Carbapenemase of KPC-group
      was found in 8% K. pneumoniae strains. OXA-48 carbapenemase prevailed
      (95%) among S. marcescens strains. Most of E. coli isolates harbored
      metallo-beta-lactamase NDM (89%). Other members of Enterobacterales most
      often had OXA-48 carbapenemase (57%), 39% of the isolates carried
      blaNDM-group. In one strain, a combination of blaNDM-group and
      blaOXA-48-like was discovered. RT-PCR is a fast and reliable method for
      the detection of acquired carbapenemases and can be recommended for
      routine use in bacteriological laboratories.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the clinical features of children with
      carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) infection and the molecular
      characteristics of isolated strains. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was
      performed on the clinical data and infection status of the children who
      were hospitalized in Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital from January
      2018 to June 2021. A total of 1 098 non-repetitive strains of
      Enterobacterales were obtained. Drug sensitivity test, PCR amplification,
      and resistance-related gene sequencing were performed for 66 isolated CRE
      strains to observe molecular epidemiology. RESULTS: Among the 1 098
      strains of Enterobacterales, the detection rate of CRE was 6.01% (66/1
      098). The 66 CRE strains were isolated from 66 children, among whom there
      were 37 boys (56%) and 29 girls (44%), with an age of 2 days to 14 years.
      Among these 66 children, 16 (24%) had an age of 36 months. The children
      with CRE were mainly distributed in the department of neonatology (38
      children, 58%) and the pediatric intensive care unit (17 children, 26%).
      The top three types of specimens with CRE detection were respiratory
      specimens (48%), midstream urine specimens (21%), and blood specimens
      (17%). The CRE strains were mainly Klebsiella pneumoniae (45 strains,
      68%), Escherichia coli (12 strains, 18%), and Enterobacter cloacae (6
      strains, 9%), with high resistance to carbapenems (such as imipenem and
      ertapenem), penicillin, and cephalosporins, slightly high resistance to
      commonly used antibiotics, and relatively low resistance to amikacin
      (14%), levofloxacin (23%), and tobramycin (33%). The carbapenemase
      genotypes of Klebsiella pneumoniae strains were mainly bla(NDM) (20
      strains, 44%), bla(IMP) (10 strains, 22%), and bla(KPC) (5 strains, 11%),
      and the carbapenemase genotypes of Escherichia coli strains were mainly
      bla(NDM) (10 strains, 83%). After sequencing, there were 24 bla(NDM-1)
      strains, 6 bla(NDM-5) strains, 5 bla(IMP-4) strains, and 3 bla(KPC-2)
      strains, and some genotypes were not identified. CONCLUSIONS: There is a
      high incidence rate of CRE infection among children, mainly those aged
      1-12 months. CRE generally has high resistance to antibacterial drugs, and
      metalloenzymes are the main type of carbapenemases for CRE strains in
      children.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The incidence of carbapenem resistance among nosocomial
      Gram-negative bacteria in Vietnam is high and increasing, including among
      Enterobacterales. In this study, we assessed the presence of one of the
      main carbapenemase genes, bla(KPC), among carbapenem-resistant
      Enterobacterales (CRE) from four large hospitals in Hanoi, Vietnam,
      between 2010 and 2015, and described their key molecular characteristics.
      METHODS: KPC-producing Enterobacterales were detected using conventional
      PCR and were further analysed using S1 nuclease pulsed-field gel
      electrophoresis (S1-PFGE), Southern blotting and whole-genome sequencing
      (WGS) for sequence typing and genetic characterisation. RESULTS: bla(KPC)
      genes were detected in 122 (20.4%) of 599 CRE isolates. bla(KPC)-carrying
      plasmids were diverse in size. Klebsiella pneumoniae harbouring bla(KPC)
      genes belonged to ST15 and ST11, whereas KPC-producing Escherichia coli
      showed more diverse sequence types including ST3580, ST448, ST709 and
      ST405. Genotypic relationships supported the hypothesis of circulation of
      a population of 'resident' resistant bacteria in one hospital through the
      years and of transmission among these hospitals via patient transfer. WGS
      results revealed co-carriage of several other antimicrobial resistance
      genes and three different genetic contexts of bla(KPC-2). Among these, the
      combination of ISEcp1-bla(CTX-M) and ISKpn27-bla(KPC)-ΔISKpn6 on the same
      plasmid is reported for the first time. CONCLUSION: We describe the
      dissemination of bla(KPC)-expressing Enterobacterales in four large
      hospitals in Hanoi, Vietnam, since 2010, which may have started earlier,
      along with their resistance patterns, sequence types, genotypic
      relationship, plasmid sizes and genetic context, thereby contributing to
      the overall picture of the antimicrobial resistance situation in
      Enterobacterales in Vietnam.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We isolated the carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae
      (CPE) strains from children during 2016-2021 in Shanghai, China and
      investigated the antimicrobial resistance, molecular and epidemiological
      features of these isolates. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility tests
      were performed to confirm the carbapenem resistance. Carbapenemase
      production was assessed by the rapid phenotypic identification of five
      major carbapenemases (KPC, NDM, VIM, IMP, and OXA-48), which were further
      confirmed by PCR amplification and sequencing. Multilocus sequence typing
      (MLST) was conducted for phylogenetic analyses. RESULTS: A total of 320
      CPE strains were collected from 2016 to 2021, consisting of
      carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (CP-Kpn, 55.0%), Escherichia
      coli (CP-Eco, 24.5%) and Enterobacter cloacae (CP-Ecl, 20.4%) and others
      (2, 0.1%). NDM was the primary carbapenemase (67.6%) in children, followed
      by KPC(26.4%), IMP(5.3%) and OXA-48 (0.6%). The minimum inhibitory
      concentration (MIC) for imipenem has been increasing from 2016 to 2021.
      NDM and KPC isolates are high resistant while IMP strains show the lower
      resistant to imipenem. Invasive infection accounted for 10.7% of
      CPE-related infections and was mainly caused by CP-Kpn (70.6%). NDM-Kpn
      was detected in 51.8% of infants (70.8% of neonates), while KPC-Kpn was
      mainly isolated from non-infants (56.3%∼64.3%). ST11 was the primary clone
      (64.6%) of KPC-Kpn and presented an increasing trend from 2016 to 2021.
      CONCLUSION: NDM is widely prevalent and transfers among CPE strains in
      children. NDM-Kpn shows the most serious threat to infants, especially to
      neonates. High-risk clone of ST11 KPC-Kpn should be paid more attention
      and monitored continuously in children.

AB  - Decreased susceptibility to carbapenems in Enterobacterales is an emerging
      concern. Conventional methods with short turnaround times are crucial for
      therapeutic decisions and infection control. In the current study, we used
      the Xpert CARBA-R (Cepheid, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and the NG-Test CARBA 5
      (NG Biotech, Guipry, France) assays for carbapenemase detection in 214
      carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) blood isolates. We used the
      modified carbapenem inactivation method, conventional PCR, and sequencing
      to determine the production of five common carbapenemase families and
      their subtypes. We performed wzc-genotyping for all CR-Klebsiella
      pneumoniae (CRKP) and multilocus sequence typing for all
      carbapenemase-producing CRE isolates to reveal their genetic relatedness.
      The results showed a sensitivity of 99.8% and a specificity of 100% by the
      Xpert assay, and a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 99% by the
      NG-Test in detecting carbapenemases of 84 CRKP isolates with only one
      (VIM-1+IMP-8) failure in both tests. For CR-Escherichia coli, four
      carbapenemase-producing isolates were detected accurately for their
      subtypes. The two major clones of carbapenemase-producing CRKP isolates in
      Taiwan were ST11-K47 producing KPC-2 (n = 47) and ST11-K64 producing
      OXA-48-like (n = 9). Our results support the use of either test in routine
      laboratories for the rapid detection of common carbapenemases. Caution
      should be taken using the Xpert assay in areas with a high prevalence of
      CRE carrying bla(IMP-8). IMPORTANCE Carbapenemase-producing
      Enterobacterales (CPE) are emerging worldwide, causing nosocomial
      outbreaks and even community-acquired infections since their appearance 2
      decades ago. Our previous national surveillance of CPE isolates in Taiwan
      identified five carbapenemase families (KPC, OXA, NDM, VIM, and IMP) with
      the KPC-2 and OXA-48-like types predominant. Timely detection and
      classification of carbapenemases in CPE may be a useful test to guide
      optimal therapy and infection control. Genetic detection methods using the
      Xpert CARBA-R assay and the immunochromatographic assay using the NG-Test
      CARBA 5 have been validated with the advantage of short turnaround time.
      Our study demonstrated that the NG and Xpert assays are convenient methods
      to accurately identify carbapenemases in carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella
      pneumoniae and carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli blood isolates.
      Detecting IMP variants remains challenging, and the results of Xpert
      CARBA-R assay should be carefully interpreted.

      KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae was recently demonstrated. We sought
      to test the combination against a broader range of serine carbapenemase
      producers. We tested the combination against 10 KPC-producing Escherichia
      coli and 10 OXA-48 family-producing K. pneumoniae isolates. Antibiotic
      concentrations used are achievable in critically ill patients. The
      combination was synergistic against 7 of 10 KPC producers and 9 of 10
      OXA-48 producers. There was no synergy detected in control isolates
      producing NDM-1.

AB  - Aim: In this study, we aimed to characterize the CRISPR-Cas systems in
      clinical carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) isolates and to
      investigate the potential association of CRISPR-Cas systems with bacterial
      virulence. Methods: A total of 168 CRKP strains were collected from
      inpatients in a teaching hospital in Jiangxi Province. Five common
      carbapenemase genes, subtype genes of the CRISPR-Cas system, and 13
      virulence genes were amplified by PCR using specific primers. The
      potential virulence of all the clinical CRKP strains was tested in a
      Galleria mellonella infection model. Results: PCR analysis of five common
      carbapenemase genes revealed the frequency of carbapenemase gene KPC-2 was
      the highest in the CRISPR-negative strains, compared to CRISPR type I-E*
      strains or CRISPR type I-E strains (p < 0.01). Isolates having the subtype
      I-E* CRISPR-Cas system tended to have more virulence genes such as magA,
      kfu, wcaG, and allS, compared to CRISPR-negative isolates and type I-E
      CRISPR-Cas isolates (p < 0.01). The average survival time of the larvae
      infected with the isolates having the subtype I-E* CRISPR-Cas system was
      significantly shorter than the other two group isolates (p < 0.05).
      Conclusion: The CRKP strains, which had the subtype I-E CRISPR-Cas system
      or the subtype I-E* CRISPR-Cas system, showed reduced acquisition of
      carbapenemase genes compared to CRISPR-negative isolates. Importantly, we
      first found that a small portion of "CR-hvKP" strains were selected from
      the CRKP clones, which had the type I-E* CRISPR-Cas systems.

AB  - Inhibition of β-lactamases is a promising strategy to overcome
      antimicrobial resistance to commonly used β-lactam antibiotics. Boronic
      acid derivatives have proven to be effective inhibitors of β-lactamases
      due to their direct interaction with the catalytic site of these enzymes.
      We synthesized a series of phenylboronic acid derivatives and evaluated
      their structure-activity relationships as Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenemase (KPC-2) inhibitors. We identified potent KPC-2 inhibitors 2e
      & 6c (Ki = 0.032 μM and 0.038 μM, respectively) that enhance the activity
      of cefotaxime in KPC-2 expressing Escherichia coli. The measured acid
      dissociation constants (pKa) of selected triazole-containing phenylboronic
      acids was broad (5.98-10.0), suggesting that this is an additional
      property of the compounds that could be tuned to optimize the target
      interaction and/or the physicochemical properties of the compounds. These
      findings will help to guide the future development of boronic acid
      compounds as inhibitors of KPC-2 and other target proteins.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The review aims to review the positioning of
      meropenem-vaborbactam in clinical practice, taking into consideration the
      characteristics of other available drugs, namely ceftazidime-avibactam,
      plazomicin, and colistin. AREAS COVERED: The search terms
      'meropenem-vaborbactam' or RX7009 for the years 2006 until 2021 were used.
      EXPERT OPINION: Coupling of meropenem with the cyclic boronate derivative
      varobactam enhances considerably the in vitro intrinsic activity of
      meropenem against isolates producing KPC (Klebsiella pneumoniae-producing
      carbapenemase). The drug has linear elimination and the ratio of the area
      under the curve of the free drug to the minimum inhibitory concentration
      is the main pharmacodynamics variable determining bacterial clearance.
      Meropenem-vaborbactam is currently approved for the management of
      complicated urinary tract infections including acute pyelonephritis,
      complicated intraabdominal infections, and hospital-acquired pneumonia

AB  - BACKGROUND: Our hospital experienced an outbreak of OXA-48-producing
      Enterobacteriaceae, triggering this study. We aimed to describe the
      population with carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) in our
      hospital from 2014 to 2018, the phenotypic and genotypic characteristics
      of isolates, and strategies to stop the outbreak. METHODS: We performed a
      retrospective study, including every patient with CPE species in a
      clinical sample. Epidemiology, risk factors, treatment and outcomes were
      gathered from medical records. RESULTS: A total 113 patients were
      included, ranging from 5 in 2015 to 83 in 2018. In 2018 the number of CPE
      went from 4 in May to 20 in July. With the implemented measures,
      propagation stopped. Implantable devices were present in 36% of patients
      and open wounds in 34%. Antibiotics had been prescribed to 71% of patients
      in the prior 30 days and most of the patients had been hospitalized for
      more than 5 days prior to sample collection or had a hospital stay in the
      previous year.Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most common species (87%).
      OXA-48 (62%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae-carbapenemase (KPC) (15%) were the
      most common carbapenemases, with OXA-48 being implicated in the 2018
      outbreak. The case fatality rate at 30 days was 32%. Combination therapy
      resulted in less mortality. CONCLUSIONS: While KPC is the most common
      carbapenemase in Europe and Portugal, we experienced an important OXA-48
      outbreak. Surveillance should be in place as these isolates are probably
      spreading. Effective communication, multidisciplinary team work and proper
      infection control measures are some of the best strategies during
      outbreaks.

AB  - Rapid detection of carbapenemases as a cause of resistance is beneficial
      for infection control and antimicrobial therapy. The BD Phoenix NMIC-502
      panel and CPO detect test identifies presence of carbapenemases in
      Enterobacterales such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and assigns them to Ambler
      classes. To evaluate the performance of the CPO detect panel, we employed
      a European collection of 1222 K. pneumoniae including carbapenem
      non-susceptible and susceptible clinical isolates from 26 countries, for
      which draft genomes were available after Illumina sequencing and the
      presence of carbapenemase genes had been identified by ARIBA gene calling.
      The CPO panel detected 488 out of 494 carbapenemase-encoding isolates as
      positive and six as negative. One-hundred and two isolates were tested
      positive for carbapenemase in the absence of any carbapenemase gene. The
      CPO panel identified 229 out of 230 KPC-positive isolates as carbapenemase
      producing and classified 62 of these as class A enzyme. Similarly, the CPO
      panel correctly specified 167 of 182 as class D. Regarding
      metallo-beta-lactamases, the CPO panel assigned 78 of 90 MBL positive
      isolates to class B enzymes. The sensitivity of the CPO panel in detecting
      carbapenemase activity was 99.5%, 97.7% and 98.3% for class A, B and D
      enzymes, respectively. The sensitivity in assignation to Ambler class A, B
      and D was 27%, 86% and 91%, respectively. An overall sensitivity of 98.8%
      and specificity of 86% in unclassified detection of carbapenemases was
      observed, with frequent false positive detection of carbapenemase
      producing organisms, thus rendering further confirmatory tests necessary.

AB  - It has been reported that many antibiotics used today, including the
      carbapenem group, fail to treat Klebsiella pneumoniae infections
      effectively. Despite many studies in recent years, the definitive
      treatment for carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) infections
      is still uncertain. In this study, it was aimed to investigate in vitro
      activities of colistin (COL) and meropenem (MEM), which are frequently
      used in the treatment of CRKP infections, and ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA),
      which is recently used in our country, alone or in combination against
      different CRKP isolates having different carbapenem resistance mechanisms
      andto analyze whether the presence of colistin resistance, which is an
      important problem in CRKP strains, influences the drug interaction
      results. This study was carried out in 42 K.pneumoniae isolates, which
      were isolated from various clinical samples as an infectious agent in
      Süleyman Demirel University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Medical
      Microbiology, Bacteriology Laboratory and whose carbapenem resistance was
      confirmed by carbapenemase inactivation test. The carbapenemase genes of
      the isolates were determined by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
      method. Antimicrobial susceptibilities of CRKP strains to CZA, MEM, and
      COL were determined by the broth microdilution method and in vitro synergy
      activities of dual combinations of these drugs were evaluated by
      checkerboard and time-kill methods. Statistical evaluation of categorical
      data was performed using Fisher's exact test, and p-value of less than
      0.05 was considered statistically significant in terms of difference
      between the groups. Of the 42 CRKP isolates 34 (81%) were only OXA-48
      positive, 5 (11.9%) were OXA-48+NDM and 3 (7.1%) were OXA-48+KPC positive.
      In the checkerboard test, synergy was detected against 97.6% of the
      isolates both with CZA+MEM and CZA+COL combinations, whereas this rate was
      50% with MEM+COL. In the time-kill test, synergy was detected with CZA+MEM
      and CZA+COL combinations in the OXA-48 positive isolate and OXA-48+KPC
      positive isolate, while synergy was detected with CZA+COL and MEM+COL
      combinations in the OXA-48+NDM positive isolate. There was no significant
      relationship between whether the isolates were resistant to colistin or
      not and the checkerboard test results of antibiotic combinations
      (pCZA+MEM= 0.33, pCZA+COL= 0.11, pMEM+COL= 0.61). Results of our study
      revealed that the most common carbapenemase type in CRKP isolates was
      OXA-48 in our hospital, and the combinations of CZA with MEM and COL had
      high potential for synergism against these isolates.

AB  - The spread of multidrug-resistant (MDR) Klebsiella pneumoniae in the
      nosocomial setting represents a big challenge to infection control teams.
      We have recently developed a simple spectroscopic-based method with
      excellent accuracy, turnaround time and cost-effectiveness (Rodrigues et
      al. mSystems 2020) for bacterial typing. Here, we applied our method in a
      real clinical context to support early identification of an outbreak
      involving KPC-3-producing K. pneumoniae ST147 isolates. Our results
      further support that attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform
      infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy can provide enough information to support
      early and adequate infection control measures and therapeutic choices in
      the context of nosocomial outbreaks and hospital surveillance.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and characteristics
      of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) from 3 tertiary-care
      Korean university hospitals between 2017 and 2018. Non-duplicated clinical
      isolates of Enterobacteriaceae showing resistance to any carbapenem agents
      were collected prospectively from 3 tertiary university hospitals between
      2017 and 2018. The presence of carbapenemase genes was detected by
      multiplex PCR and sequencing for bla(KPC), bla(VIM), bla(NDM), bla(IMP),
      bla(OXA), and bla(GES) was performed. Among the 690 potential
      carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) isolates, 66.8% (N = 461)
      were CPE. The species distribution of CPE was as follows: Klebsiella
      pneumoniae was most common (75.9%), followed by Escherichia coli (15.0%),
      Citrobacter freundii (4.6%), Enterobacter cloacae (2.6%), Klebsiella.
      aerogenes (0.7%), and Klebsiella. oxytoca (0.4%). All 11 CPE genes were
      detected, particularly K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-2 (87.6%), New
      Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM)-1 (7.4%), NDM-5 (1.7%), KPC-3 (1.3%),
      oxacillinase (OXA)-232 (1.1%), and OXA-181 (1.1%). Six isolates produced 2
      or 3 carbapenemases. The majority of the carbapenemase-producing C.
      freundii tested positive for NDM-1. We confirmed a high proportion of CPE
      among the CRE isolates with a high prevalence of KCP-2-producing K.
      pneumoniae and E. coli. Therefore, there is a need for undertaking
      continuous surveillance to monitor the prevalence of CPE.

AB  - Infection caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) is a
      global public health problem. We performed whole-genome sequencing to
      investigate the molecular epidemiological characteristics of local CRE
      infections and understand the prevalence of hypervirulent
      carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP). Analysis of multiLocus
      sequence typing (MLST), antibiotic resistance genes, plasmid replicons,
      virulence genes, and the genetic environment was also performed.
      Klebsiella pneumoniae (89, 60.95%) was the most common CRE species,
      primarily prevalent in the intensive care unit (36, 40.45%). Most CRE
      strains showed a high resistance rate to multiple antibiotics, especially
      cephalosporins and carbapenems. However, most of these isolates were
      susceptible to tigecycline (81.7%). Notably, the predominant sequence type
      (ST) of CRKP isolates was ST11 (80.90%, 72/89), with 93.05% as Klebsiella
      pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-ST11. In Escherichia coli isolates, ST410
      (21.43%, 6/28) was the predominant type, with approximately half carrying
      bla(NDM-5), and importantly, the ST167 carbapenem-resistant Escherichia
      coli (CRECO) harbors both New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM)-5 and KPC-2.
      In Enterobacter cloacae isolates, three cases of ST88 were carrying the
      bla(NDM-1) gene, and the ST594 carbapenem-resistant Enterobacter cloacae
      (CRECC) carrying NDM-1 and KPC-2 has also been identified. In addition, we
      found three novel STs, ST5386-ST5388. The IncFII (pHN7A8) (98.41%, 62/63)
      was the most common plasmid replicon type in KPC-2-producing CRKP strains,
      and the predominant plasmid ST of IncF was [f33:A-:B-] (n = 73). Two CRKP
      isolates were found to carry 4 virulence genes (iutA, iroB, rmpA, and
      rmpA2). As concluded, among CRKP strains, ST11 was the predominant ST with
      bla(KPC-2), and a large proportion of CRKP strains co-harbor bla(KPC-2),
      bla(SHV), bla(CTX-M), bla(TEB-1B), and fosA. The predominant carbapenemase
      genes carried by CRECO and CRECC were bla(NDM-1) and bla(CTX-M),
      respectively.

AB  - PURPOSE: The rapid detection of carbapenemases among Enterobacterales in
      clinical laboratories is critical for management of patients, and
      infection prevention and control efforts. METHODS: A study was designed to
      evaluate the performances of the RAPIDEC CARBA NP®, β-CARBA®, NG-Test
      CARBA 5®, modified carbapenem-inactivation method, and EDTA version (eCIM)
      assays against a global collection of Enterobacterales (n = 216) with
      diverse carbapenemases. RESULTS: The RAPIDEC CARBA NP® assay had a
      sensitivity of 98.6% and specificity of 19.6% and β-CARBA® a sensitivity
      of 94% and specificity of 97.8%, but showed low sensitivity with
      Klebsiella Pneumoniae Carbapenemase (KPC)-containing isolates. The NG-Test
      CARBA 5® had an overall sensitivity of 96.3% and specificity of 100% and
      failed to detect isolates with bla(IMP-13), bla(IMP-14). The eCIM gave
      false- positive results with Oxacillinase (OXA)-48-like enzymes.
      CONCLUSION: The NG-Test CARBA 5® assay was technically simple and provided
      rapid accurate results on the types of carbapenemases. Such information
      has potential treatment benefits for patients.

AB  - In over eighty years, despite successive antibiotics discoveries, the
      rapid advent of multidrug resistance among bacterial pathogens has jolted
      our misapprehension of success over them. Resistance is spreading faster
      than the discovery of new antibiotics/antimicrobials. Therefore, the
      search for better antimicrobials/additives becomes prudent. A
      water-soluble curcumin derivative (Cur(aq)) was synthesised, employing a
      Cu (I) catalysed 1, 3-cyclo addition reaction; it has been evaluated as a
      potential treatment for multidrug-resistant isolates and as an antibiotic
      adjuvant for meropenem against hypervirulent multidrug-resistant
      Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. We also investigated its solubility and
      effect over carbapenemase activity. Additionally, we investigated its
      impact on the AcrAB-TolC system. We found that Cur(aq) inhibited bacterial
      growth at a minimal concentration of 16 µg/mL; at a 32 µg/mL
      concentration, it killed bacterial growth completely. Only nine (9.4%)
      Klebsiella isolates were sensitive to meropenem; however, after
      synergising with Cur(aq) (8 µg/mL), 85 (88.54%) hvKP isolates became
      sensitive to the drug. The Cur(aq) also inhibited the AcrAB-TolC efflux
      system at 1 µg/mL concentration by disrupting the membrane potential and
      causing depolarisation. The kinetic parameters obtained also indicated its
      promise as a carbapenemase inhibitor. These results suggest that Cur(aq)
      can be an excellent drug candidate as a broad-spectrum antibacterial and
      anti-efflux agent.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Secondary healthcare will remain pressured for some years,
      both because SARS-CoV-2 will circulate as a nosocomial pathogen, and owing
      to backlogs of patients awaiting delayed elective procedures. These
      stresses will drive the use of Outpatient Parenteral Antibiotic Therapy
      (OPAT), which will need to cover increasingly resistant Gram-negative
      opportunists. We evaluated the activity of ertapenem/zidebactam, proposed
      for 2 + 2 g q24h administration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: MICs were
      determined, by BSAC agar dilution, for 1632 Enterobacterales submitted to
      the UK national reference laboratory for investigation of antimicrobial
      resistance. RESULTS: Over 90% of Escherichia coli with AmpC, ESBLs, KPC,
      metallo- or OXA-48 carbapenemases were inhibited by ertapenem/zidebactam
      1:1 at ertapenem's current 0.5 mg/L breakpoint. For other major
      Enterobacterales, the proportions inhibited by ertapenem/zidebactam 1:1 at
      0.5 mg/L were mostly 65% to 90% but were lower for Klebsiella
      pneumoniae/oxytoca with metallo- or OXA-48 β-lactamases. However, animal
      studies support an 8 mg/L breakpoint for ertapenem/zidebactam, based on a
      shortened T>MIC being needed compared with ertapenem alone. On this basis
      ertapenem/zidebactam would count as active against 90%-100% of isolates in
      all groups except K. pneumoniae/oxytoca with MBLs (±OXA-48), where MICs
      and percent susceptibility vary substantially even with inocula within the
      BSAC acceptable range. CONCLUSIONS: Ertapenem/zidebactam has a proposed
      once-daily regimen well suited to OPAT. Even on highly conservative
      breakpoint projections, it has potential against MDR E. coli, including
      metallo-carbapenemase producers. If trial data sustain the 8 mg/L
      breakpoint indicated by animal experiments, its potential will extend
      widely across infections due to ESBL-, AmpC- and carbapenemase-producing
      Enterobacterales.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Carbapenemase-mediated antimicrobial resistance is currently
      a hot spot of global concern. Carbapenem-resistant organisms are highly
      prevalent in hospitals associated with difficult-to-treat infections,
      resulting in poor clinical outcome due to limited treatment options. It is
      urgently needed to have a rapid, efficient, and convenient molecular assay
      for identifying such resistant strains. METHODS: For this end, we
      developed a new laboratory assay targeting Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenemase (KPC) and New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM) based on
      loop-mediated isothermal amplification, CRISPR-Cas12a, and lateral flow
      immunochromatographic strip (CRISPR-Cas-LAMP-lateral flow strip). The
      method was designed to use a guide RNA (gRNA) to recognize the target DNA
      and guide Cas12a to cleave the target DNA, and simultaneously cleave any
      single-stranded DNA within the cleavage reaction system. RESULTS: The
      cleavage products are visible to the naked eye on the lateral flow strip.
      This method is highly sensitive in direct detection of bacteria in samples
      containing at least 3×10(5) CFU/mL without the need for bacterial culture.
      DISCUSSION: It provides shorter turnaround time and higher specificity
      than the conventional bacterial culture and susceptibility testing method.
      This new assay is applicable for extensive use in hospital infection
      control, as well as identification and treatment of resistant strains due
      to simple operation and inexpensive apparatuses.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the prevalence of acquired β-lactamase genes and
      susceptibility profiles of carbapenem-nonsusceptible Enterobacterales
      (CNSE) clinical isolates collected in US hospitals during a 5-year period.
      METHODS: Isolates were susceptibility tested by reference broth
      microdilution methods. Results were interpreted using CLSI breakpoints.
      Isolates displaying nonsusceptible MICs for imipenem or meropenem were
      categorized as CNSE. CNSE isolates were screened for β-lactamase-encoding
      genes using whole-genome sequencing. New genes were cloned, expressed in
      an Escherichia coli background and susceptibility tested. RESULTS: A total
      of 450 (1.3%) isolates were CNSE. Klebsiella pneumoniae serine
      carbapenemase (KPC) production was the most common resistance mechanism
      among CNSE isolates: 281/450 (62.4%) carried bla (KPC), including three
      new variants. OXA-48-like and metallo-β-lactamase (MBL) encoding genes
      were detected among seven and 12 isolates, respectively. Among MBL genes,
      bla (NDM-1) was the most common, but bla (NDM-5), bla (VIM-1) and bla
      (IMP-27) were also identified. 169 (37.6% of the CNSE) isolates did not
      produce carbapenemases. Ceftazidime/avibactam was the most active agent
      (95.0% to 100.0% susceptible) against CNSE isolates from all carbapenemase
      groups except MBL-producing isolates. Ceftazidime/avibactam,
      meropenem/vaborbactam and imipenem/relebactam inhibited 100.0%, 97.6% and
      92.3% of the non-carbapenemase CNSE isolates, respectively. Among the
      three new bla (KPC) variants, one conferred resistance to
      ceftazidime/avibactam and low meropenem MIC results while the other two
      had profiles similar to bla (KPC-2) or bla (KPC-3). CONCLUSIONS: A decline
      in carbapenemase production was noticed in US hospitals in the 5-year
      period analysed in this study. New β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor
      combinations tested had good activity against CNSE isolates.

      fosfomycin and linezolid was started. After an initial response a CZA
      resistant CPKP strain was isolated from CSF culture, so the antibiotic
      therapy was modified to FDC with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole for 14
      days, and EVD was replaced. A complete recovery was obtained. This is the
      first case report describing FDC administration in CPKP meningitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The increasing number of carbapenemase-producing
      Enterobacterales (CPE) has become a serious problem globally. This study
      aimed to elucidate their geographically epidemiological characteristics.
      METHODS: Resistance genes were identified by polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR) and sequencing. Bacterial genotyping was studied using multilocus
      sequence typing (MLST) and wzi typing. The transferability of
      carbapenemase genes was determined by a broth mating method. The
      relationships between the rates of antimicrobial consumption and the
      prevalence of CRE were performed by Pearson's or Spearman's correlation
      analyses. RESULTS: A total of 930 phenotypically confirmed
      carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) isolates collected from 19
      hospitals were genotypically characterized. K. pneumoniae (KP) and E. coli
      isolates were 785 (85.14%) and 96 (10.41%) among 922 CPE isolates. Two
      major carbapenemase genes blaKPC-2 and blaNDM in CPE isolates accounted
      for 84.6% (n = 780) and 13.77% (n = 127). ST11 comprised 86.83% (633/729)
      of KPC-2 KP isolates. Different combinations of extended
      spectrum-β-lactamase (ESBL) genes of blaSHV, blaCTX, and blaTEM were found
      in KPC-2 producing KP isolates, and blaCTM-M-14/15, blaSHV-11/12 and
      blaTEM-1 were common ESBL genotypes. The wzi typing method could further
      subdivide ST11 KP group into at least five subgroups, among which wzi209
      (69.83%, 442/633) was the most frequently isolated, followed by wzi141
      (25.28%, 160/633). Conjugation assays showed that high conjugation rates
      were observed in CPE (15.24%, 32/210) for NDM plasmids, but relatively low
      (8.1%, 17/210) for KPC-2 plasmids. Different STs, different wzis and
      temperature could influence plasmid conjugation efficiency. No
      associations between the rates of antibiotics consumption and CPE
      prevalence were observed. The number of intra-hospital and inter-hospital
      transfers of CPE patients increased gradually from 18 (17.82%, 101) and 12
      (11.88%, 101) in 2015 to 63 (30.73%, 205) and 51 (24.88%, 205) in 2018 (p
      = 0.016 and p = 0.008), respectively. Evidence-based measures could
      effectively reduce the prevalence of ST11-wzi209 clone but failed to
      control the dissemination of ST11-wzi141 KP clone. CONCLUSIONS: Clonal
      spread of CPE, especially KPC-2 ST11 KP was the key factor contributing to
      the CPE increase in the region. Continued vigilance for the importations
      should be maintained. Coordinated regional interventions are urgently
      needed to reduce CPE threat.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to determine the in vitro efficacy
      of intravenous (IV) fosfomycin against extensively drug-resistant
      Enterobacterales strains and the effect of glucose 6-phosphate (G6-P) on
      sensitivity results. MATERIAL METHOD: Thirty-two extensively
      drug-resistant Klebsiella pneumonia strains were included in the study.
      Detection of the carbapenemase genes was performed using the Gene-Xpert®
      System Carba R® kit. Susceptibility of IV fosfomycin was assessed using
      the agar dilution method. The agar dilution method was repeated using
      Muller-Hinton Agar medium without G6-P to assess the effect of G6-P on
      sensitivity results. RESULTS: All strains in the study produced
      carbapenemases and were resistant to all drugs tested, including
      carbapenems, piperacillin-tazobactam, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime.
      Fosfomycin resistance was detected in 3 (9.3%) strains. When the
      sensitivity test was repeated without G6-P, fosfomycin resistance was
      detected in 82.7% of the fosfomycin-susceptible strains. The Gene-Xpert®
      System showed NDM-1 in 46.8%, OXA-48 in 18.7%, KPC in 3.1%, and NDM-1 +
      OXA-48 in 21.8% of the strains. OXA-48 was detected in one of the
      resistant strains, and none of the viable genes were detected in two of
      the resistant strains. CONCLUSION: This study shows that IV fosfomycin is
      a potentially important treatment alternative for infections caused by
      common resistant strains. Accurate results may not be obtained unless G6-P
      is used in the agar dilution method for in vitro susceptibility studies of
      fosfomycin.

AB  - This study examined the susceptibility of carbapenem-nonsusceptible
      Enterobacterales (CNSE) to cefiderocol, cefepime/zidebactam,
      cefepime/enmetazobactam, omadacycline, eravacycline and other comparative
      agents. Non-duplicate Enterobacterales isolates from 16 Taiwanese
      hospitals were evaluated. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were
      determined using the broth microdilution method, and susceptibility
      results were interpreted based on relevant guidelines. In total, 201 CNSE
      isolates were investigated, including 26 Escherichia coli isolates and 175
      Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. Carbapenemase genes were detected in 15.4%
      (n=4) of E. coli isolates and 47.4% (n=83) of K. pneumoniae isolates, with
      the most common being bla(KPC) (79.3%, 69/87), followed by
      bla(OXA-48-like) (13.8%, 12/87). Cefiderocol was the most active agent
      against CNSE; only 3.8% (n=1) of E. coli isolates and 4.6% (n=8) of K.
      pneumoniae isolates were not susceptible to cefiderocol. Among the
      carbapenem-resistant E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates, 88.5% (n=23) and
      93.7% (n=164), respectively, were susceptible to ceftazidime/avibactam.
      For cefepime/zidebactam, 23 (88.5%) E. coli isolates and 155 (88.6%) K.
      pneumoniae isolates had MICs ≤2/2 mg/L. For cefepime/enmetazobactam, 22
      (84.6%) E. coli isolates and 85 (48.6%) K. pneumoniae isolates had MICs
      ≤2/8 mg/L. The higher MICs of K. pneumoniae against
      cefepime/enmetazobactam were due to only one (1.5%) of the 67
      bla(KPC)-carrying isolates being susceptible. MICs of omadacycline were
      significantly higher than those of eravacycline and tigecycline. In
      summary, cefiderocol, ceftazidime/avibactam and cefepime/zidebactam were
      more effective against carbapenem-nonsusceptible E. coli and K. pneumoniae
      than other drugs, highlighting their potential as valuable therapeutics.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae is a major cause of severe healthcare-associated
      infections and often shows MDR phenotypes. Carbapenem resistance is
      frequent, and colistin represents a key molecule to treat infections
      caused by such isolates. Here we evaluated the antimicrobial resistance
      (AMR) mechanisms and the genomic epidemiology of clinical K. pneumoniae
      isolates from Serbia. Consecutive non-replicate K. pneumoniae clinical
      isolates (n = 2,298) were collected from seven hospitals located in five
      Serbian cities and tested for carbapenem resistance by disk diffusion.
      Isolates resistant to at least one carbapenem (n = 426) were further
      tested for colistin resistance with Etest or Vitek2. Broth microdilution
      (BMD) was performed to confirm the colistin resistance phenotype, and
      colistin-resistant isolates (N = 45, 10.6%) were characterized by Vitek2
      and whole genome sequencing. Three different clonal groups (CGs) were
      observed: CG101 (ST101, N = 38), CG258 (ST437, N = 4; ST340, N = 1; ST258,
      N = 1) and CG17 (ST336, N = 1). mcr genes, encoding for acquired colistin
      resistance, were not observed, while all the genomes presented mutations
      previously associated with colistin resistance. In particular, all strains
      had a mutated MgrB, with MgrB(C28S) being the prevalent mutation and
      associated with ST101. Isolates belonging to ST101 harbored the
      carbapenemase OXA-48, which is generally encoded by an IncL/M plasmid that
      was no detected in our isolates. MinION sequencing was performed on a
      representative ST101 strain, and the obtained long reads were assembled
      together with the Illumina high quality reads to decipher the bla (OXA-)
      (48) genetic background. The bla (OXA-) (48) gene was located in a novel
      IncFIA-IncR hybrid plasmid, also containing the extended spectrum
      β-lactamase-encoding gene bla (CTX-M-15) and several other AMR genes.
      Non-ST101 isolates presented different MgrB alterations (C28S, C28Y,
      K2(∗), K3(∗), Q30(∗), adenine deletion leading to frameshift and premature
      termination, IS5-mediated inactivation) and expressed different
      carbapenemases: OXA-48 (ST437 and ST336), NDM-1 (ST437 and ST340) and
      KPC-2 (ST258). Our study reports the clonal expansion of the newly
      emerging ST101 clone in Serbia. This high-risk clone appears adept at
      acquiring resistance, and efforts should be made to contain the spread of
      such clone.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) is a global
      threat. Enterobacterales develops carbapenem resistance through several
      mechanisms, including the production of carbapenemases. We aim to describe
      the prevalence of Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) with and
      without carbapenemase production and distribution of
      carbapenemase-producing (CP) genes in Thailand using 2016-2018 data from a
      national antimicrobial resistance surveillance system developed by the
      Thailand National Institute of Health (NIH). METHODS: CRE was defined as
      any Enterobacterales resistant to ertapenem, imipenem, or meropenem.
      Starting in 2016, 25 tertiary care hospitals from the five regions of
      Thailand submitted the first CRE isolate from each specimen type and
      patient admission to Thailand NIH, accompanied by a case report form with
      patient information. NIH performed confirmatory identification and
      antimicrobial susceptibility testing and performed multiplex polymerase
      chain reaction testing to detect CP-genes. Using 2016-2018 data, we
      calculated proportions of CP-CRE, stratified by specimen type, organism,
      and CP-gene using SAS 9.4. RESULTS: Overall, 4,296 presumed CRE isolates
      were submitted to Thailand NIH; 3,946 (93%) were confirmed CRE. Urine (n =
      1622, 41%) and sputum (n = 1380, 35%) were the most common specimen types,
      while blood only accounted for 323 (8%) CRE isolates. The most common
      organism was Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 2660, 72%), followed by
      Escherichia coli (n = 799, 22%). The proportion of CP-CRE was high for all
      organism types (range: 85-98%). Of all CRE isolates, 2909 (80%) had one
      CP-gene and 629 (17%) had > 1 CP-gene. New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase
      (NDM) was the most common CP-gene, present in 2392 (65%) CRE isolates. K.
      pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) and Verona integron-encoded
      metallo-β-lactamase (VIM) genes were not detected among any isolates.
      CONCLUSION: CP genes were found in a high proportion (97%) of CRE isolates
      from hospitals across Thailand. The prevalence of NDM and OXA-48-like
      genes in Thailand is consistent with pattern seen in Southeast Asia, but
      different from that in the United States and other regions. As
      carbapenemase testing is not routinely performed in Thailand, hospital
      staff should consider treating all patients with CRE with enhanced
      infection control measures; in line with CDC recommendation for enhanced
      infection control measures for CP-CRE because of their high propensity to
      spread.

AB  - Aim: We aim to depict the clinicoepidemiological and molecular information
      of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriales (CRE) in Chongqing, China.
      Methods: We performed a prospective, observational cohort study,
      recruiting inpatients diagnosed with CRE infections from June 1, 2018, to
      December 31, 2019. We carried out strain identification and molecular
      characterization of CRE. eBURST analysis was conducted to assess the
      relationships among the different isolates on the basis of their sequence
      types (STs) and associated epidemiological data using PHYLOViZ. Clinical
      parameters were compared between the carbapenemase-producing
      Enterobacteriales (CPE) and non-CPE group. Findings: 128 unique CRE
      isolates from 128 patients were collected during the study period: 69
      (53.9%) CPE and 59 (46.1%) non-CPE. The majority of CPE isolates were bla
      (KPC-2) (56.5%), followed by bla (NDM) (39.1%) and bla (IMP) (5.8%).
      Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing clonal group 11
      Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) was the most common CPE. Antibiotic
      resistance was more frequent in the CPE group than in the non-CPE group.
      Independent predictors for CPE infection were ICU admission and
      hepatobiliary system diseases. Although, there was no significant
      difference in desirability of outcome ranking (DOOR) outcomes between the
      two groups. At 30 days after index culture, 35 (27.3% ) of these patients
      had died. Conclusion: CRE infections were related to high mortality and
      poor outcomes, regardless of CRE subgroups. CPE were associated with
      prolonged ICU stays and had different clinical and microbiological
      characteristics than non-CPE. The identification of CPE/non-CPE and CRE
      resistance mechanisms is essential for better guidance of the clinical
      administration of patients with CRE infections.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Klebsiella michiganensis is an emerging pathogen. Like
      Klebsiella pneumoniae, this species is able to acquire antibiotic
      resistance genes (ARGs) via mobile genetic elements. In this context, K.
      michiganensis isolates producing carbapenemases of KPC, NDM, IMP and
      OXA-48-like types have already been reported. Here we characterised a
      strain (BD-50-Km) isolated from a rectal swab of a Turkish patient
      hospitalised in Switzerland. METHODS: Species identification was initially
      performed using MALDI-TOF/MS. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was
      done by the microdilution method. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was
      performed with both Illumina and Nanopore platforms and was used to
      confirm species identification, to characterise plasmids and to perform
      core-genome analyses. RESULTS: BD-50-Km was initially identified as
      Klebsiella oxytoca and showed reduced susceptibility to imipenem. However,
      WGS indicated that the isolate was actually K. michiganensis. BD-50-Km
      carried the bla(VIM-1) gene associated with a rare class 1 integron (In87)
      located on a pST1 196 kb IncC plasmid. This plasmid shares its backbone
      with many other IncC plasmids found in different species (including five
      K. michiganensis), but not the same In87 and the remaining region
      harbouring various ARGs. BD-50-Km belongs to the novel ST342. Moreover,
      core-genome analysis (single nucleotide variant analysis) showed that
      BD-50-Km was not closely related to any K. michiganensis strains deposited
      in NCBI (n = 212), including the 38 so far reported as possessing
      carbapenemase genes. CONCLUSION: This is the first report of a
      bla(VIM)-possessing K. michiganensis clinical isolate. The spread of
      plasmid-mediated VIM carbapenemases in this emerging pathogen represents
      an additional threat to our therapeutic armamentarium.

AB  - The rise of Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) represents an
      increasing threat to patient safety and healthcare systems worldwide.
      Citrobacter spp., long considered not to be a classical nosocomial
      pathogen, in contrast to Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, is
      fast gaining importance as a clinical multidrug-resistant pathogen. We
      analyzed the genomes of 512 isolates of 21 CRE species obtained from 61
      hospitals within a three-year-period and found that Citrobacter spp. (C.
      freundii, C. portucalensis, C. europaeus, C. koseri and C. braakii) were
      increasingly detected (n=56) within the study period. The
      carbapenemase-groups detected in Citrobacter spp. were KPC, OXA-48/-like
      and MBL (VIM, NDM) accounting for 42%, 31% and 27% respectively, which is
      comparable to those of K. pneumoniae in the same study. They accounted for
      10%, 17% and 14% of all carbapenemase-producing CRE detected in 2017, 2018
      and 2019, respectively. The carbapenemase genes were almost exclusively
      located on plasmids. The high genomic diversity of C. freundii is
      represented by 22 ST-types. KPC-2 was the predominantly detected
      carbapenemase (n=19) and was located in 95% of cases on a highly-conserved
      multiple-drug-resistance-gene-carrying pMLST15 IncN plasmid. KPC-3 was
      rarely detected and was confined to a clonal outbreak of C. freundii ST18.
      OXA-48 carbapenemases were located on plasmids of the IncL/M (pOXA-48)
      type. About 50% of VIM-1 was located on different IncN plasmids (pMLST7,
      pMLST5). These results underline the increasing importance of the
      Citrobacter species as emerging carriers of carbapenemases and therefore
      as potential disseminators of Carbapenem- and multidrug-resistance in the
      hospital setting.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) pose a significant
      global public health threat. Resistance among CRE is particularly complex,
      owing to numerous possible resistance mechanisms and broad definitions. We
      aimed to characterize the clinical and molecular profiles of CRE in the
      South Texas region. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared the clinical,
      genotypic, and phenotypic profiles of carbapenemase producing
      Enterobacterales (CPE) with those of non-carbapenemase producers (NCPE)
      isolated from South Texas, United States between 2011 and 2019. Molecular
      characteristics and resistance mechanisms were analyzed using whole-genome
      sequences. RESULTS: The majority (59%) of the CRE isolates were NCPE while
      41% of isolates harbored carbapenemases, predmonantly bla (KPC)-type. The
      most common CPE was Klebsiella pneumoniae while majority of Enterobacter
      cloacae and Escherichia coli were NCPE Among K. pneumoniae, the clonal
      group 307 has emerged as a predmoninant group and was associated with as
      many CRE infections as the previous common clonal group 258. Patients with
      NCPE compared to CPE infections were associated with higher antimicrobial
      exposure prior to culture collection (days of therapy, 795 vs. 242; p <
      0.001) and emergency department visits within past 90 days (22% vs. 4%; p
      = 0.011). The all cause 30-day mortality was 21%. CONCLUSIONS: This study
      highlights the diversity of resistance mechanisms underlying CRE in South
      Texas, with 59% not harboring a carbapenemase. Individuals with NCPE
      infections were more likely to have had prior antimicrobial therapy and
      emergency department visits compared to those with CPE. Identification and
      distinction of these mechanisms by rapid identification of species and
      carbapenemase would allow for optimal treatment and infection control
      efforts.

AB  - Infection by carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKp) hampers the
      treatment of elderly patients with lower respiratory tract infection
      (LRTI); however, relevant data with respect to the characteristics of CRKp
      in elderly patients with LRTIs are limited. In the present study, K.
      pneumoniae isolated from elderly patients with LRTIs was collected and
      identified by VITEK-MS. VITEK 2 compact was used for drug sensitivity test
      to screen CRKps, and broth dilution method was used for drug sensitivity
      of tigecycline and colistin. The resistance genes, virulence genes, and
      serotypes of CRKps were detected via polymerase chain reaction. The
      homology of CRKps was analyzed via PFGE and MLST. Moreover, plasmid
      conjugation experiment was carried out to determine the transferability of
      carbapenem resistance. PCR-based replicon typing (PBRT) and S1
      nuclease-PFGE were conducted for plasmid profiling. From January 2019 to
      August 2019, 258 elderly patients with LRTIs caused by K. pneumoniae were
      observed; of these, 31 (12.02%) infections were caused by CRKp strains.
      Majority of the patients were admitted to the intensive care unit and
      neurosurgery wards. Intracranial hemorrhage and pneumonia were the most
      common underlying diseases. Furthermore, 29 patients infected by CRKp had
      been exposed to various antimicrobial drugs before the positive culture.
      All isolates exhibited high resistance to β-lactam antibiotics. The
      predominant carbapenem resistance gene was bla(KPC-2), and CRKps carrying
      bla(KPC-2) were all ST11 type. Two bla(NDM-5) carrying isolates were
      assigned to ST307 and ST1562, respectively. Conjugative assays revealed
      that plasmids harboring bla(NDM-5) gene were self-transmissible. Plasmid
      analysis suggested that two bla(NDM-5) were located on a ~45 kb IncX3 type
      plasmid. The high incidence of CRKp in elderly patients with LRTIs
      indicates the urgent need for further surveillance and strict infection
      control measures.

AB  - Acquired resistance towards ceftazidime-avibactam (CAZ-AVI) is
      increasingly reported. Several mechanisms can be involved, but mutations
      in the Ω-loop region of β-lactamases are the most described. Herein, we
      assessed the implementation of Chromatic Super CAZ/AVI(®) medium in rectal
      swab surveillance cultures in a geographic area with endemic distribution
      of KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. Routine rectal swabs collected
      from the intensive care unit (ICU) and non-ICU patients were screened for
      carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE), carbapenem-resistant
      Gram-negative organisms (CR-GN) and CAZ-AVI-resistant organisms by
      Chromatic CRE and Super CAZ/AVI(®) media. Among the 1839 patients
      screened, 146 (7.9%) were found to be colonized by one or more CPE and/or
      CR-GN isolates during hospitalization. Overall, among colonized patients
      the most common bacteria encountered were KPC-producing Enterobacterales
      (n = 60; 41.1%), carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 41;
      28.1%) and carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii (n = 34; 23.3%). Among
      patients colonized by KPC-producing Enterobacterales, thirty-five (58.3%)
      had CAZ-AVI-resistant strains. A 30.5% rate of faecal carriage of
      CAZ-AVI-resistant KPC-producing K. pneumoniae, substantially higher than
      that of susceptible isolates (2.8%), was observed in the COVID-19 ICU.
      Prevalence of faecal carriage of metallo-β-lactamase-producing organisms
      was low (0.5% and 0.2% for Enterobacterales and P. aeruginosa,
      respectively). Chromatic Super CAZ/AVI(®) medium showed 100% sensitivity
      in detecting CPE or CR-GN isolates resistant to CAZ-AVI regardless of both
      MIC values and carbapenemase content. Specificity was 86.8%. The Chromatic
      Super CAZ/AVI(®) medium might be implemented in rectal swab surveillance
      cultures for identification of patients carrying CAZ-AVI-resistant
      organisms to contain the spread of these difficult-to-treat pathogens.

AB  - Introduction. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) have been
      responsible for nosocomial outbreaks worldwide and have become endemic in
      several countries.Hypothesis/Gap Statement. To better understand the
      epidemiological trends and characteristics of CRE in the Henan
      province.Aim. We assessed the molecular epidemiological characteristics of
      305 CRE strains isolated from patients in 19 secondary or tertiary
      hospitals in ten areas of the Henan province in China.Methodology. A total
      of 305 CRE isolates were subjected to multiple tests, including in vitro
      antimicrobial susceptibility testing, PCR for carbapenemase genes bla
      (KPC), bla (NDM), bla (IMP), bla (VIM), bla (OXA)-(48-like).
      Tigecycline-resistant genes ramR, oqxR, acrR, tetA, rpsJ, tetX, tetM, tetL
      were analysed in five tigecycline non-susceptible carbapenem-resistant
      Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates (TNSCRKP). Additionally, multilocus
      sequence typing (MLST) was performed for carbapenem-resistant K.
      pneumoniae (CRKP).Results. The most common CRE species were K. pneumoniae
      (234, 77 %), Escherichia coli (36, 12 %) and Enterobacter cloacae (13, 4
      %). All strains exhibited multi-drug resistance. Overall, 97 % (295/305)
      and 97 % (297/305) of the isolates were susceptible to polymyxin B and
      tigecycline, respectively. A total of 89 % (271/305) of the CRE isolates
      were carbapenemase gene-positive, including 70 % bla (KPC), 13 % bla
      (NDM), 6 % bla (IMP), and 1 % combined bla (KPC)/bla (NDM) genes. K.
      pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) was the predominant carbapenemase in K.
      pneumoniae (87 %), whereas NDM and IMP were frequent in E. coli (53 %) and
      E. cloacae (69 %), respectively. Mutations in the ramR, tetA, and rpsJ
      genes were detected in five TNSCRKP. Moreover, 15 unique sequence types
      were detected, with ST11 (74 %), ST15 (9 %) and ST2237 (5 %) being
      dominant among K. pneumoniae strains.Conclusion. A high proportion of CRE
      strains were carbapenemase-positive, and five carbapenem-resistant K.
      pneumonia isolates were tigecycline non-susceptible, indicating a need for
      the ongoing surveillance of CRE and effective measures for the prevention
      of CRE infections.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to identify the risk factors for subsequent
      carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) infections in patients with
      initial rectal colonization with CRE. METHODS: We conducted a
      retrospective case-control study on inpatients with rectal CRE
      colonization between January 2019 and December 2020. Clinical and
      microbiological data were extracted from hospital patients' medical
      records and the clinical microbiology laboratory. Risk factors were
      assessed and compared between patients with CRE colonization who had
      subsequent infections and those who did not have infections. RESULTS:
      Among 1064 patients screened for CRE, we enrolled 205 patients with rectal
      CRE colonization. Among the 205 colonized bacteria, 78.5% were Klebsiella
      pneumoniae, with 62.9% of them producing Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenemase (KPC). Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed
      that more than three times hospitalization (p = 0.026), being in a coma (p
      = 0.019), and exposure to carbapenems (p = 0.015) were independent risk
      factors for CRE clinical infection among CRE rectal carriers. CONCLUSION:
      This is the first study to report that more than three times
      hospitalization is an independent risk factor for subsequent CRE clinical
      infection in CRE intestinal carriers. Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella
      pneumoniae is the most important species isolated from hospitalized CRE
      rectal carriers and is the most common cause of subsequent infections.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) are of
      global concern due to the growing number of patients who acquire them and
      their association with high mortality rates. Although there are some
      reports of endemicity in developing countries, little is known about this
      microorganism, and Ecuador is not an exception. Subsequently, our
      objective was to clinically and molecularly characterize carbapenemase
      producing-Enterobacteriaceae in intensive care units (ICUs) in Guayaquil,
      Ecuador. METHODS: To determine CPE colonization, we obtained perineal and
      inguinal swabs from patients admitted to seven intensive-care adult units
      in Guayaquil-Ecuador between February and April 2016. The Centers for
      Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) laboratory protocol and chromogenic
      agar were used to process the cultures. Polymerase chain reaction was used
      to confirm carbapenemase production. Genotypic analysis was performed by
      Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) and pulsed-field electrophoresis (PFEG).
      Demographic and clinical data were obtained from the electronic charts and
      patient's relatives. RESULTS: Six hundred seventy-seven patients were
      included in the study, of whom 255 were colonized/infected by CPE. The CPE
      prevalence was 37.67%. Previous use of antimicrobials, use of invasive
      procedures and being burned at admission were associated with CPE. The
      most frequent infection was found after a surgical procedure. Klebsiella
      pneumoniae (n=249) was the predominant microorganism harbouring bla(KPC),
      followed by Enterobactercloacae (n=8), Klebsiella aerogenes (n=4),
      Escherichia coli (n=4) and Klebsiella oxytoca (n=1). NDM was present in
      Proteus mirabilis. The strains were distributed in 19 sequence types (ST),
      and 10 were not reported previously in Ecuador. ST 258 was the sequence
      type isolated most frequently. CONCLUSION: This study shows a high
      prevalence of CPE in ICUs, particularly K. pneumoniae bla(KPC) ST 258. The
      identification of KPC alleles may help to understand the routes of
      dissemination and control spread within ICUs in Guayaquil, Ecuador.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Enterobacter cloacae complex (ECC) has awakened interest
      recently because of its increasing resistance to carbapenems codified by
      several genes all over the globe. Even though there are some sequence
      types (STs) which represent high-risk clones, there is substantial clonal
      diversity in the ECC. This work aimed to perform whole-genome sequencing
      (WGS), genomic analysis, and phylogenetic studies of a Klebsiella
      pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) -producing multidrug-resistant (MDR) ECC
      isolate from Argentina. METHODS: We analysed the genome of an MDR
      KPC-producing ECC strain isolated from a urine sample from a patient in a
      hospital in Argentina. The WGS was done by Illumina MiSeq-I (Illumina, San
      Diego, CA). The genome was assembled with SPAdes 3.9.0, and annotated with
      PROKKA, RAST, and Blast. Plasmids were identified with PlasmidFinder.
      Antibiotic resistance genes were detected using RESfinder, CARD, and
      Blastn. STs were identified with pubMLST. RESULTS: The strain was
      identified as Enterobacter hormaechei, an important emerging human
      pathogen. No ST could be assigned; six of seven alleles of multilocus
      sequence typing (MLST) were the same as for E. hormaechei ST66, which is a
      high-risk clone. We found multiple acquired antibiotic resistance genes,
      including bla(KPC-2) in an IncM1 plasmid, and a secretion system VI, which
      can favour the prevalence of ECC strains while competing with other
      bacteria. CONCLUSION: Because of its MLST profile being so close to that
      of E. hormaechei ST66, the acquisition of multiple resistance genes, and
      the presence of the secretion systems, the potential of this strain for
      becoming a new high-risk clone cannot be discarded.

AB  - Enterobacterales as opportunistic pathogens are commonly associated with
      nosocomial infections. With increasing frequency, Gram-negative bacilli,
      especially Klebsiella pneumoniae strains, are mul- tidrug-resistant or
      pandrug-resistant. Carbapenems were used as the drugs of choice for the
      treat- ment of infections caused by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative
      bacilli. The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of the
      RESIST-4 O.K.N.V. K-SeT for the rapid detection and identification of the
      most important carbapenemases (OXA-48, KPC, NDM, VIM) in Enterobacterales
      bacilli. The study involved the isolates of 97 Enterobacterales strains.
      The ability to produce carbapenemases was determined by the
      immunochromatographic RESIST-4 O.K.N.V. K-SeT test. This test detected
      carbapenemases OXA-48, KPC, NDM, and VIM. For the RESIST-4 O.K.N.V. K-SeT
      test, a positive result was obtained for 93 strains (95.9%). Four strains
      negative in the RESIST-4 O.K.N.V. K-SeT were positive in the
      Eazyplex®SuperBugCRE and PCR. These strains produce VIM enzymes. RE-
      SIST-4 O.K.N.V. K-SeT test is rapid, simple to perform and can be used for
      fast detection of the most important carbapenemases (OXA-48, KPC, NDM,
      VIM) among Gram-negative bacilli.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), currently listed
      by the World Health Organization (WHO) as top priority critical pathogens,
      are a major global menace to human health. In low- and middle-income
      countries (LMICs) the threat is mounting fueled by selective pressures
      caused by antibiotic abuse and inadequate diagnostic resources. METHODS:
      This study phenotypically and genotypically characterized carbapenem
      resistance among 115 Enterobacterales isolates including 76 Klebsiella
      (K.) pneumoniae, 19 Escherichia (E.) coli, 14 Shigella (S.) sonnei, 5
      Enterobacter (E.) cloacae, and 1 Proteus (P.) mirabilis. RESULTS:
      Ninety-three isolates (80.9%) were carbapenem-resistant with an alarming
      57.5% carbapenem non-susceptibility in isolates collected from the
      outpatient department. Molecular characterization of the carbapenemases
      (CPases) encoding genes showed that bla(NDM) (80.5%) was the most
      prevalent; it was detected in 62 isolates (54 K. pneumoniae, 6 E. coli and
      2 S. sonnei), followed by bla(VIM) (36.4%) which was observed in 28
      isolates (24 K. pneumoniae, 3 E. coli and 1 E. cloacae). Other CPases
      included bla(KPC) (28.6%; in 20 K. pneumoniae, 1 E. coli and 1 S. sonnei),
      bla(OXA-48) (26%; in 17 K. pneumoniae, 1 E. coli,1 E. cloacae and 1 P.
      mirabilis), bla(IMP) (6.5%; in 5 K. pneumoniae) and bla(SPM) (1.3%; in K.
      pneumoniae). Notably more than half of the Enterobacterales isolates
      (54.5%) co-harboured more than one CPase-encoding gene. Co-existence of
      bla(NDM) and bla(VIM) genes was the most dominant (31.2%), followed by
      association of bla(NDM) and bla(KPC) (24.7%), then bla(VIM) and bla(KPC)
      (13%). Moreover, the effects of different genotypes on meropenem MIC
      values were assessed, and a statistically significant difference between
      the genotype (Ambler classes A and B) and the genotype (Ambler classes B
      and D) was recorded. CONCLUSION: The current findings may serve for a
      better understanding of the context of CRE in Egypt, associated drivers
      and CPases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A crucial barrier to the routine application of whole-genome
      sequencing (WGS) for infection prevention is the insufficient criteria for
      determining whether a genomic linkage is consistent with transmission
      within the facility. We evaluated the use of single-nucleotide variant
      (SNV) thresholds, as well as a novel threshold-free approach, for
      inferring transmission linkages in a high-transmission setting. METHODS:
      We did a retrospective genomic epidemiology analysis of samples previously
      collected in the context of an intervention study at a long-term acute
      care hospital in the USA. We performed WGS on 435 isolates of Klebsiella
      pneumoniae harbouring the bla(KPC) carbapenemase (KPC-Kp) collected from
      256 patients through admission and surveillance culturing (once every 2
      weeks) of almost every patient who was admitted to hospital over a 1-year
      period. FINDINGS: Our analysis showed that the standard approach of using
      an SNV threshold to define transmission would lead to false-positive and
      false-negative inferences. False-positive inferences were driven by the
      frequent importation of closely related strains, which were presumably
      linked via transmission at connected health-care facilities.
      False-negative inferences stemmed from the diversity of colonising
      populations that were spread among patients, with multiple examples of
      hypermutator strain emergence within patients and, as a result, putative
      transmission links separated by large genetic distances. Motivated by
      limitations of an SNV threshold, we implemented a novel threshold-free
      transmission cluster inference approach, in which each of the acquired
      KPC-Kp isolates were linked back to the imported KPC-Kp isolate with which
      it shared the most variants. This approach yielded clusters that varied in
      levels of genetic diversity but where 105 (81%) of 129 unique strain
      acquisition events were associated with epidemiological links in the
      hospital. Of 100 patients who acquired KPC-Kp isolates that were included
      in a cluster, 47 could be linked to a single patient who was positive for
      KPC-Kp at admission, compared with 31 and 25 using 10 SNV and 20 SNV
      thresholds, respectively. Holistic examination of clusters highlighted
      extensive variation in the magnitude of onward transmission stemming from
      more than 100 importation events and revealed patterns in cluster
      propagation that could inform improvements to infection prevention
      strategies. INTERPRETATION: Our results show how the integration of
      culture surveillance data into genomic analyses can overcome limitations
      of cluster detection based on SNV-thresholds and improve the ability to
      track pathways of pathogen transmission in health-care settings. FUNDING:

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) remain an urgent
      public health priority in the United States. CRE poses a major threat to
      patients in healthcare and a potential risk to the community. This study
      examined the epidemiological trends, clinical, and microbiological data of
      CRE in the Greater Houston region of Texas. METHODS: A multi-institutional
      retrospective observational study was conducted using surveillance data
      collected from 2015 to 2020. Predictors of incidence rates of CRE were
      determined by a negative binomial regression fit using a generalized
      estimation equation. RESULTS: Over a 6-year period, 4236 CRE cases were
      reported, of which Klebsiella pneumoniae accounted for 84.8%. The results
      show a steady increase in CRE cases, with a sharp rise since 2018. The
      majority of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales were Klebsiella
      pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing (77.2%), followed by other rare
      carbapenemases, which includes OXA-48, NDM, IMP, VIM, coproduction of KPC
      with OXA-48, KPC with NDM, and NDM with OXA-48. Acute care hospitals (ACH)
      accounted for 68.5% of the source of CRE cases. The incidence rate of CRE
      cases reported from ACH and long-term acute care (LTAC) facilities was
      1.16 times that of long-term care facilities (adjusted rate ratio [ARR] =
      1.16, 95% confidence interval [CI]:1.04-1.30). The incidence rate of CRE
      among patients with indwelling devices was 15% (ARR = 0.85, 95% CI:
      0.79-0.92) lower than that of patients without indwelling devices.
      CONCLUSION: The rise in the rate of CRE cases despite aggressive infection
      prevention and control strategies in the region is alarming. Evaluating
      and improving the current infection control strategies may be warranted.

      isolates with the rapid carbapenemase detection method (rCDM)

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Carbapenem antibiotics are widely used for the treatment of
      infections caused by multidrug-resistant bacteria. As a result of this,
      resistance to carbapenems is gradually increasing. Identification of
      carbapenemase production, one of the reasons for resistance, through
      molecular methods is expensive and time-consuming. In the present study,
      it was aimed to investigate the sensitivity of the newly developed rapid
      carbapenemase detection method (rCDM) as compared to the gold standard
      molecular method and to evaluate its consistency with another phenotypical
      method, the modified carbapenem inactivation method (mCIM). MATERIAL AND
      METHODS: In our study, a total of 152 Gram-negative bacteria (Klebsiella
      pneumoniae, Escherichia coli) isolated from various clinical samples of
      which 50 were controls were included. Strain identification was done by
      using VITEK®MS (bioMérieux, Marcy-I'Étoile, France), carbapenem
      sensitivity was tested by using VITEK®2 (bioMérieux). For
      carbapenem-resistant isolates, carbapenem resistance genes were detected
      with multiplex PCR [Carbapenem and Colistin Resistance qPCR kit (Bioeksen,
      İstanbul, Turkey)] kit by a molecular method. All included isolates were
      evaluated by the rCDM and mCIM tests in order to detect carbapenemase
      phenotypically. The molecular method was accepted to be the gold standard
      and the sensitivity of rCDM was calculated. The McNemar test was applied
      to analyze the difference between two phenotypic tests (rCDM and mCIM) and
      Cohen's Kappa analysis was applied to determine consistency. RESULTS: Out
      of 102 carbapenem-resistant isolates, at least one of the resistance genes
      in the multiplex PCR panel (bla(KPC), bla(NDM), bla(VIM), bla(IMP),
      bla(OXA-51), bla(OXA23/58), bla(OXA-48)) was detected in 92 and
      bla(OXA-48) was the most common (90.2%). The sensitivity of the rapid
      carbapenemase detection method was found to be 100%. When the results of
      the two phenotypic methods were compared, no statistically significant
      difference could be found (P(McNemar):1, Kappa coefficient:1.00).
      CONCLUSION: The rapid carbapenemase detection method was found to be
      suitable to use in routine laboratory analysis as its sensitivity was
      found to be high, exhibited a good performance for detection of frequent
      carbapenemase types in our country (Turkey), a high consistency with mCIM,
      and also it is an easily applied and rapid method.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to describe our experience of a
      combination treatment including meropenem/vaborbactam (M/V) plus aztreonam
      (ATM) for bloodstream infections (BSIs) due to
      ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CAZ/AVI-R-Kp), for
      which gene typing was not available at the time the blood culture (BC)
      results were obtained. METHODS: Between 20 July and 22 August 2021, in our
      hospital laboratory, the molecular test for carbapenemase gene typing was
      not available. All Gram-negative bloodstream infections were recorded, and
      characteristics of patients were analysed. Among them, three patients had
      positive BCs for CAZ/AVI-R-Kp, and the empirical therapy was switched to
      M/V plus ATM pending phenotypic testing of sensitivity to M/V. Therapy was
      subsequently targeted on the basis of the results of this test. RESULTS:
      KPC and NDM represent the most prevalent carbapenemases in our polyclinic.
      Three patients with CAZ/AVI-R-Kp sepsis were treated with M/V plus ATM not
      knowing the carbapenemase gene. Two had an NDM-Kp infection for which,
      upon obtaining the result of sensitivity to M/V, combination therapy was
      maintained. The third had KPC-Kp infection for which ATM was discontinued,
      after the acquisition of an antibiogram reporting full sensitivity to M/V
      (MIC = 0.25 mg/L). One patient with NDM-Kp infection died due to
      complications of the underlying disease for which he was hospitalised.
      CONCLUSIONS: Meropenem/vaborbactam plus ATM and subsequent de-escalation
      could represent a possible therapeutic strategy in severe CAZ/AVI-R-Kp
      infections when carbapenemase gene typing is not rapidly available.

AB  - Duplex polymerase chain reaction with lateral flow dipsticks (duplex
      PCR-LFD) was developed for the simultaneous detection of beta-lactamase
      Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (bla(KPC) ) and beta-lactamase New
      Dehli metallo-beta-lactamase (bla(NDM) ) genes in body fluid samples. This
      method was validated using well-characterized isolates. The assessment of
      the specificity of duplex PCR-LFD showed that there was no
      cross-reactivity with other targets. The detection limit of the duplex
      PCR-LFD assay was 20 CFU per ml for bla(KPC) and bla(NDM) . Among 177
      sterile body fluid samples tested by the duplex PCR-LFD assay, 40 were
      bla(KPC) -positive and five were bla(NDM) -positive. The results obtained
      from 122 corresponding Gram-negative bacteria which were isolated from
      these clinical samples and tested by duplex PCR-LFD assay showed that
      there were 37 strains carrying bla(KPC) genes in 40 bla(KPC) -positive
      samples and three strains carrying bla(NDM) genes in five bla(NDM)
      -positive samples. Statistical analysis indicated that there was no
      significant difference between the direct detection of bla(KPC) and
      bla(NDM) genes in clinical sterile body fluid samples and their
      corresponding clinical isolates. Therefore, duplex PCR-LFD can be
      effective for the simultaneous detection of bla(KPC) and bla(NDM) in
      clinical isolates and directly from clinical samples, which may be helpful
      for the administration of appropriate antimicrobial treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: In contrast to other qnr families, qnrVC has been reported
      mainly in Vibrio spp. and inserted in class 1 integrons. This study aimed
      to identify the variants of qnrVC genes detected in Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenemase-2-producing Enterobacter and Klebsiella strains isolated
      from Brazilian coastal waters and the genetic contexts associated with
      their occurrence. METHODS: qnrVC variants were identified by Sanger
      sequencing. Stains were typified by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis.
      Antimicrobial susceptibility testing, conjugation assays, and whole genome
      sequencing (WGS) were applied to identify the strains' antimicrobial
      resistance profile, qnrVC and bla(KPC-2) co-transference, and qnrVC
      genetic context. RESULTS: qnrVC1 was identified in 15 Enterobacter and 3
      Klebsiella, and qnrVC4 in 2 Enterobacter strains. Pulsed-field gel
      electrophoresis revealed 12 clonal profiles of Enterobacter and one of
      Klebsiella. Strains were resistant to aminoglycosides, beta-lactams,
      fosfomycin, quinolones, and sulfamethoxazole-trimethoprim. Co-transference
      of qnrVC and bla(KPC)(-2) were obtained from five representative
      Enterobacter strains, which showed resistance to ampicillin and
      amoxicillin-clavulanate, and reduced susceptibility to extended-spectrum
      cephalosporins, meropenem, and ciprofloxacin. WGS analysis from
      representative strains revealed one K. quasipneumoniae subsp.
      similipneumoniae, one E. soli, four E. kobei, and seven isolates belonging
      to Enterobacter Taxon 3. Long-read WGS showed qnrVC and bla(KPC)(-2) were
      carried by the same replicon on Klebsiella and Enterobacter strains, and
      the qnrVC association with not previously described genetic environments
      composed of insertion sequences and truncated genes. These contexts
      occurred in small- and high-molecular-weight plasmids belonging to IncFII,
      IncP6, pKPC-CAV1321, and IncU groups. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that
      the dissemination of qnrVC among Enterobacterales in Brazilian coastal
      waters is associated with several genetic recombination events.

AB  - The aim of the present study is to describe the ongoing spread of the
      KPC-producing strains, which is evolving to an epidemic in Czech
      hospitals. During the period of 2018-2019, a total of 108 KPC-producing
      Enterobacterales were recovered from 20 hospitals. Analysis of long-read
      sequencing data revealed the presence of several types of
      bla(KPC)-carrying plasmids; 19 out of 25 bla(KPC)-carrying plasmids could
      be assigned to R (n = 12), N (n = 5), C (n = 1) and P6 (n = 1)
      incompatibility (Inc) groups. Five of the remaining bla(KPC)-carrying
      plasmids were multireplicon, while one plasmid couldn't be typed.
      Additionally, phylogenetic analysis confirmed the spread of
      bla(KPC)-carrying plasmids among different clones of diverse
      Enterobacterales species. Our findings demonstrated that the increased
      prevalence of KPC-producing isolates was due to plasmids spreading among
      different species. In some districts, the local dissemination of IncR and
      IncN plasmids was observed. Additionally, the ongoing evolution of
      bla(KPC)-carrying plasmids, through genetic rearrangements, favours the
      preservation and further dissemination of these mobile genetic elements.
      Therefore, the situation should be monitored, and immediate infection
      control should be implemented in hospitals reporting KPC-producing
      strains.

AB  - Results from sampling healthcare surfaces for pathogens are difficult to
      interpret without understanding the factors that influence pathogen
      detection. We investigated the recovery of four healthcare-associated
      pathogens from three common surface materials, and how a body fluid
      simulant (artificial test soil, ATS), deposition method, and contamination
      levels influence the percent of organisms recovered (%R). Known quantities
      of carbapenemase-producing KPC+ Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC), Acinetobacter
      baumannii, vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis, and Clostridioides
      difficile spores (CD) were suspended in Butterfield's buffer or ATS,
      deposited on 323cm2 steel, plastic, and laminate surfaces, allowed to dry
      1h, then sampled with a cellulose sponge wipe. Bacteria were eluted,
      cultured, CFU counted and %R determined relative to the inoculum. The %R
      varied by organism, from 1 log10 within the 60 min drying time. For all
      organisms, the %R was significantly greater if suspended in ATS than if
      suspended in Butterfield's buffer (p<0.05), and for most organisms the %R
      was not significantly different when sampled from any of the three
      surfaces. Organisms deposited in multiple droplets were recovered at equal
      or higher %R than if spread evenly on the surface. This work assists in
      interpreting data collected while investigating a healthcare infection
      outbreak or while conducting infection intervention studies.

AB  - To explore the mutational possibilities of insertions and deletions
      (indels) in the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) beta-lactamase,
      we selected for ceftazidime-avibactam-resistant mutants. Of 96 screened
      mutants, we obtained 19 indels (2 to 15 amino acids), all located in the
      loops surrounding the active site. Three antibiotic susceptibility
      phenotypes emerged: an extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase-like phenotype, an
      activity restricted to ceftazidime, and a carbapenem-susceptible KPC-like
      phenotype. Tolerance for indels reflects the evolvability of KPC
      beta-lactamase, which could challenge the therapeutic management of
      patients.

AB  - β-Lactamase-mediated resistance to ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA) is a
      serious limitation in the treatment of Gram-negative bacteria harboring
      Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC). Herein, the basis of
      susceptibility to carbapenems and resistance to ceftazidime (CAZ) and CZA
      of the D179Y variant of KPC-2 and -3 was explored. First, we determined
      that resistance to CZA in a laboratory strain of Escherichia coli DH10B
      was not due to increased expression levels of the variant enzymes, as
      demonstrated by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). Using timed mass
      spectrometry, the D179Y variant formed prolonged acyl-enzyme complexes
      with imipenem (IMI) and meropenem (MEM) in KPC-2 and KPC-3, which could be
      detected up to 24 h, suggesting that IMI and MEM act as covalent
      β-lactamase inhibitors more than as substrates for D179Y KPC-2 and -3.
      This prolonged acyl-enzyme complex of IMI and MEM by D179Y variants was
      not observed with wild-type (WT) KPCs. CAZ was studied and the D179Y
      variants also formed acyl-enzyme complexes (1 to 2 h). Thermal
      denaturation and differential scanning fluorimetry showed that the
      tyrosine substitution at position 179 destabilized the KPC β-lactamases
      (KPC-2/3 melting temperature [T(m)] of 54 to 55°C versus D179Y T(m) of
      47.5 to 51°C), and the D179Y protein was 3% disordered compared to KPC-2
      at 318 K. Heteronuclear (1)H/(15)N-heteronuclear single quantum coherence
      (HSQC) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy also revealed that
      the D179Y variant, compared to KPC-2, is partially disordered. Based upon
      these observations, we discuss the impact of disordering of the Ω loop as
      a consequence of the D179Y substitution. These conformational changes and
      disorder in the overall structure as a result of D179Y contribute to this
      unanticipated phenotype.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization-Time of Flight
      Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS), commonly used for microorganism
      identification, can also be applied for the detection of
      carbapenemase-producing bacteria by the evaluation of carbapenem
      hydrolysis. Since KPC- and NDM-producing bacteria are related to high
      mortality rates, diagnostic assays for its detection are essential. The
      aim of this study was to develop and evaluate a method to establish a
      quantitative measure (hydrolysis index - HI) to detect meropenem
      hydrolysis by MLADI-TOF MS. METHODS: bla(KPC) and bla(NDM) positive and
      negative Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates and Escherichia coli ATCC 25922
      (control) were incubated in a meropenem solution for 2 h. Protein
      extraction from these suspensions were submitted to MALDI-TOF MS analysis.
      The intensity of peaks at 384 m/z and 379 m/z of each isolate were used to
      establish the HI as follows: HI = (Peak intensity(384 Test) / Peak
      intensity(379 Test)) / (Peak intensity(384 Control) / Peak intensity(379
      Control)). Receiver Operating Characteristic curve was used to determine a
      cutoff value to differentiate carbapenemase-producing from carbapenemase
      non-producing bacteria. RESULTS: As all carbapenemase-producing K.
      pneumoniae presented HI ≤0.55 and all carbapenemase non-producing isolates
      presented a HI ≥0.57, the index of 0.56 was established as a cutoff value
      to differentiate carbapenemase (KPC and NDM) producing and non-producing
      bacteria.

AB  - Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae are a major threat to global
      public health. Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) is the most
      commonly identified carbapenemase in the United States and is frequently
      found on mobile genetic elements including plasmids, which can be
      horizontally transmitted between bacteria of the same or different
      species. Here we describe the results of an epidemiological investigation
      of KPC-producing bacteria at two healthcare facilities. Using a
      combination of short-read and long-read whole-genome sequencing, we
      identified an identical 44 kilobase plasmid carrying the bla (KPC-2) gene
      in four bacterial isolates belonging to three different species
      (Citrobacter freundii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Escherichia coli). The
      isolates in this investigation were collected from patients who were
      epidemiologically linked in a region in which KPC was uncommon, suggesting
      that the antibiotic resistance plasmid was transmitted between these
      bacterial species. This investigation highlights the importance of
      long-read sequencing in investigating the relatedness of bacterial
      plasmids, and in elucidating potential plasmid-mediated outbreaks caused
      by antibiotic resistant bacteria.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Burn patients are highly susceptible to
      invasion by multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria (MDR-GNB) through
      post-burn damage. The prevalence of MDR-GNB isolated from burns patients
      has increased dramatically in the last decade, representing a serious risk
      to patients admitted to burns units worldwide. The challenges of managing
      infected burns patients are exacerbated in poor resource settings. This
      study was designed to develop a pathway for the rapid diagnosis of
      multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative infections and identify the
      bacterial genes including bla(OXA1), bla(TEM), and bla(SHV) encoding ESBLs
      and bla(OXA48), bla(KPC), bla(NDM), and bla(VIM) encoding carbapenemases
      from the patient of post burns infection. METHODS: Clinical isolates were
      collected (August 2017 to August 2018) from Intensive care unit (ICU) of
      Burn Centre. Antibiotic susceptibility testing and phenotypic detection of
      ESBLs and carbapenemases was performed by disk diffusion, double disk
      synergy test (DDST), combination disk test (CDT), and Imipenem + EDTA
      combined disk test (IMP + EDTA CDT). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
      detection was performed for ESBLs bla(OXA1)-bla(SHV)-bla(TEM) and
      carbapenemases genes bla(OXA48)-bla(KPC)-bla(NDM)-bla(VIM) RESULTS: In
      total, of 170 Gram-negative isolates, 104 (61.2%) were confirmed as
      multidrug-resistant (MDR); Pseudomonas aeruginosa was found to be the most
      prevalent 43/104 (41.4%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae 17/104
      (16.4%), Acinetobacter baumannii12/104 (11.5%), and 6/104 Proteus
      mirabilis (5.8%). All isolates (100%) were resistant to cefotaxime and
      ceftazidime, while the meropenem resistance was 58.7%. ESBL and
      carbapenemase genotypes were found to be associated with higher MAR index
      (0.65-0.88) and MIC (> 32 µg/ml) values P. aeruginosa was the major ESBL
      and carbapenemase producer as determined by phenotypic testing and PCR.
      bla(TEM) positive isolates among ESBLs producers were predominant 81.8%
      (27/33), followed by 27.3% bla(OXA1) and bla(SHV), respectively. bla(VIM)
      positive isolates among carbapenemase producers were predominant 47.7%
      (21/44), followed by 27.3% bla(KPC), 20.5% bla(OXA48), and 11.4% bla(NDM)
      positive isolates. CONCLUSIONS: The predominant organism causing burn
      infections was ESBL and carbapenemase-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa.
      There are only limited effective antibiotics against such strains.
      bla(VIM) and bla(TEM) individually and in co-existence with bla(KPC),
      bla(OXA48), bla(SHV), and bla(OXA1) confer antimicrobial resistance in
      burns patients. Rapid detection of ESBL and carbapenemase genes will
      inform treatment strategies improving the outcome for post-burn patients
      in ICU.

AB  - Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) represents a major
      nosocomial pathogen with only a few antimicrobial agents, including
      colistin, remaining active. However, the emergence of colistin-resistant
      (Col-R) isolates is compromising the activity of colistin. In this study,
      a collection of 159 CRKP recovered from three hospitals in Moscow (Russian
      Federation) was examined. The isolates demonstrated resistance to
      cephalosporins (100%), ciprofloxacin (92.5%), fosfomycin (90.1%),
      netilmicin (81.1%), gentamicin (84.3%) and amikacin (49.7%). The rate of
      colistin resistance (MIC > 2 mg/L by broth microdilution) was 44.7%;
      moreover, 6.7% of isolates were tigecycline-resistant. Among 18 sequence
      types (STs) discovered, isolates of five lineages including ST307 (n = 46;
      28.9%), ST395 (n = 40; 25.2%), ST377 (n = 17; 10.7%), ST48 (n = 17; 10.7%)
      and ST23 (n = 16; 10.1%) dominated. Carriage of a bla(OXA-48-like)
      carbapenemase gene was detected in 146 CRKP (91.8%); 11 (6.9%) and 2
      (1.3%) isolates harboured bla(NDM-1) and bla(KPC-3), respectively. Among
      71 Col-R isolates, colistin MICs ranged from 4 mg/L to >1024 mg/L
      (MIC(50/90), 2/512 mg/L). All Col-R isolates were mcr-1-negative. In 19
      (26.8%) Col-R isolates, inactivation of mgrB by insertion sequences IS1A,
      IS1R, ISKpn14 and ISKpn26 and a novel miniature inverted-repeat
      transposable element (MITE) Kpn1 was observed. Carriage of MITEKpn1 was
      restricted to six ST307 isolates and affected mgrB at nucleotide position
      75. mgrB deletion was observed in four (5.6%) Col-R isolates. Moreover,
      PmrA and/or PmrB were altered in three (4.5%) Col-R isolates with
      wild-type mgrB. Thus, bla(OXA-48-like)-carrying Col-R ST307 K. pneumoniae
      is emerging as a dominant clone in Moscow.

AB  - In Gram-negative bacteria, the major mechanism of resistance to β-lactam
      antibiotics is the production of one or several β-lactamases (BLs),
      including the highly worrying carbapenemases. Whereas inhibitors of these
      enzymes were recently marketed, they only target serine-carbapenemases
      (e.g. KPC-type), and no clinically useful inhibitor is available yet to
      neutralize the class of metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs). We are developing
      compounds based on the 1,2,4-triazole-3-thione scaffold, which binds to
      the di-zinc catalytic site of MBLs in an original fashion, and we
      previously reported its promising potential to yield broad-spectrum
      inhibitors. However, up to now only moderate antibiotic potentiation could
      be observed in microbiological assays and further exploration was needed
      to improve outer membrane penetration. Here, we synthesized and
      characterized a series of compounds possessing a diversely functionalized
      alkyl chain at the 4-position of the heterocycle. We found that the
      presence of a carboxylic group at the extremity of an alkyl chain yielded
      potent inhibitors of VIM-type enzymes with K(i) values in the μM to sub-μM
      range, and that this alkyl chain had to be longer or equal to a propyl
      chain. This result confirmed the importance of a carboxylic function on
      the 4-substituent of 1,2,4-triazole-3-thione heterocycle. As observed in
      previous series, active compounds also preferentially contained phenyl,
      2-hydroxy-5-methoxyphenyl, naphth-2-yl or m-biphenyl at position 5.
      However, none efficiently inhibited NDM-1 or IMP-1. Microbiological study
      on VIM-2-producing E. coli strains and on VIM-1/VIM-4-producing
      multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae clinical isolates gave promising
      results, suggesting that the 1,2,4-triazole-3-thione scaffold worth
      continuing exploration to further improve penetration. Finally, docking
      experiments were performed to study the binding mode of alkanoic analogues
      in the active site of VIM-2.

AB  - Serine active-site β-lactamases hydrolyze β-lactam antibiotics through the
      formation of a covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate followed by deacylation
      via an activated water molecule. Carbapenem antibiotics are poorly
      hydrolyzed by most β-lactamases owing to slow hydrolysis of the
      acyl-enzyme intermediate. However, the emergence of the KPC-2
      carbapenemase has resulted in widespread resistance to these drugs,
      suggesting it operates more efficiently. Here, we investigated the unusual
      features of KPC-2 that enable this resistance. We show that KPC-2 has a
      20,000-fold increased deacylation rate compared with the common TEM-1
      β-lactamase. Furthermore, kinetic analysis of active site alanine mutants
      indicates that carbapenem hydrolysis is a concerted effort involving
      multiple residues. Substitution of Asn170 greatly decreases the
      deacylation rate, but this residue is conserved in both KPC-2 and
      non-carbapenemase β-lactamases, suggesting it promotes carbapenem
      hydrolysis only in the context of KPC-2. X-ray structure determination of
      the N170A enzyme in complex with hydrolyzed imipenem suggests Asn170 may
      prevent the inactivation of the deacylating water by the 6α-hydroxyethyl
      substituent of carbapenems. In addition, the Thr235 residue, which
      interacts with the C3 carboxylate of carbapenems, also contributes
      strongly to the deacylation reaction. In contrast, mutation of the Arg220
      and Thr237 residues decreases the acylation rate and, paradoxically,
      improves binding affinity for carbapenems. Thus, the role of these
      residues may be ground state destabilization of the enzyme-substrate
      complex or, alternatively, to ensure proper alignment of the substrate
      with key catalytic residues to facilitate acylation. These findings
      suggest modifications of the carbapenem scaffold to avoid hydrolysis by
      KPC-2 β-lactamase.

AB  - Background Spread of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) is a
      significant concern in intensive care unit (ICU) settings. Approaches to
      routine screening for CRE colonization in all ICU patients vary depending
      on institutional epidemiology and resources. The present study was aimed
      to evaluate the performance of HiCrome Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase
      (KPC) agar for the detection of CRE colonization in ICU settings taking
      the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommended method as
      reference. Methods Two-hundred and eighty rectal swabs (duplicate) from
      140 patients were subjected to CRE detection in HiCrome KPC agar and
      MacConkey agar (CDC criteria). Results Using CDC method, total 41 CRE
      isolates were recovered comprising of 29 Escherichia coli , 11 Klebsiella,
      and 1 Enterobacter spp. On the other hand, 49 isolates of CRE recovered
      from 140 rectal swabs using HiCrome KPC agar, out of which 33 were E. coli
      , 15 Klebsiella, and 1 Enterobacter sp. Statistical Analysis Sensitivity,
      specificity, negative, and positive predictive values of CRE screening by
      HiCrome KPC agar were found to be 100% (91.4-100), 91.9% (84.8-95.8),
      83.6% (70.9-91.4), and 100% (95.9-100), respectively, taking the CDC
      recommended method as reference. Conclusion HiCrome KPC agar has high
      sensitivity in screening CRE colonization. Further studies are needed to
      establish its applicability for detecting the predominant circulating
      carbapenemases in the Indian setting.

TI  - Analysis of a novel class A β-lactamase OKP-B-6 of Klebsiella
      quasipneumoniae: structural characterisation and interaction with
      commercially available drugs

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria produce
      beta-lactamase as factors to overcome beta-lactam antibiotics, causing
      their hydrolysis and impaired antimicrobial action. Class A beta-lactamase
      contains the chromosomal sulfhydryl reagent variable (SHV, point mutation
      variants of SHV-1), LEN (Klebsiella pneumoniae strain LEN-1), and other K.
      pneumoniae beta-lactamase (OKP) found mostly in Klebsiella's phylogroups.
      The SHV known as extended-spectrum β-lactamase can inactivate most
      beta-lactam antibiotics. Class A also includes the worrisome
      plasmid-encoded Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC-2), a
      carbapenemase that can inactivate most beta-lactam antibiotics,
      carbapenems, and some beta-lactamase inhibitors. OBJECTIVES: So far, there
      is no 3D crystal structure for OKP-B, so our goal was to perform
      structural characterisation and molecular docking studies of this new
      enzyme. METHODS: We applied a homology modelling method to build the
      OKP-B-6 structure, which was compared with SHV-1 and KPC-2 according to
      their electrostatic potentials at the active site. Using the DockThor-VS,
      we performed molecular docking of the SHV-1 inhibitors commercially
      available as sulbactam, tazobactam, and avibactam against the constructed
      model of OKP-B-6. FINDINGS: From the point of view of enzyme inhibition,
      our results indicate that OKP-B-6 should be an extended-spectrum
      beta-lactamase (ESBL) susceptible to the same drugs as SHV-1. MAIN
      CONCLUSIONS: This conclusion advantageously impacts the clinical control
      of the bacterial pathogens encoding OKP-B in their genome by using any
      effective, broad-spectrum, and multitarget inhibitor against
      SHV-containing bacteria.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) isolates have
      disseminated worldwide. CREs usually produce a carbapenemase; however,
      some isolates are negative for known carbapenemases. In this study, we
      evaluated the activity of meropenem/vaborbactam and comparators against
      CREs without a carbapenemase (nonCP CREs) collected from European
      hospitals from 2016 to 2019. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 23 043
      Enterobacterales clinical isolates were collected in 41 hospitals located
      in 20 countries. Susceptibility (S) testing was performed using the broth
      microdilution method. CLSI/EUCAST (2021) interpretive criteria were used.
      978 CREs were identified with MICs >2 mg/L to meropenem or imipenem.
      Whole-genome sequencing was performed on each CRE isolate. 125 isolates
      were negative for carbapenemase genes, including bla (KPC), bla (NDM), bla
      (IMP), bla (VIM) and bla (OXA-48-like). NonCP CRE isolates were analysed
      for the presence of other β-lactamases, multilocus sequence types (ST) and
      mutations in outer membrane protein (OMP) sequences. RESULTS: Most nonCP
      CRE were Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPN; n = 97/125). 84.0% of nonCP CRE (n =
      105) were from Poland, including 88 KPN. The most common β-lactamase was
      bla (CTX-M-15) in 92/125 isolates. OMP disruptions or alterations were
      noted among 76 KPN. Among KPN isolates that had MLST typing, 30 belonged
      to ST11, 18 to ST152 and 17 to ST147, while 13 other STs were observed.
      Susceptibility to meropenem/vaborbactam was 96.0/97.6% (CLSI/EUCAST) while
      meropenem was 2.4/8.0%S. CONCLUSIONS: Meropenem/vaborbactam had potent in
      vitro activity against CRE isolates that lacked known carbapenemases.
      Resistance mechanisms observed among nonCP CREs included acquired
      β-lactamases and OMP alterations. These results indicate that
      meropenem/vaborbactam may be a useful treatment for infections caused by
      nonCP CREs.

AB  - Understanding bacterial species at greatest risk for harboring bla(CTX-M)
      genes is necessary to guide antibiotic treatment. We identified the
      species-specific prevalence of bla(CTX-M) genes in Gram-negative clinical
      isolates from the United States. Twenty-four microbiology laboratories
      representing 66 hospitals using the GenMark Dx ePlex blood culture
      identification Gram-negative (BCID-GN) panel extracted blood culture
      results from April 2019 to July 2020. The BCID-GN panel includes 21
      Gram-negative targets. Along with identifying bla(CTX-M) genes, it detects
      major carbapenemase gene families. A total of 4,209 Gram-negative blood
      cultures were included. bla(CTX-M) genes were identified in 462 (11%)
      specimens. The species-specific prevalence of bla(CTX-M) genes was as
      follows: Escherichia coli (16%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (14%), Klebsiella
      oxytoca (6%), Salmonella spp. (6%), Acinetobacter baumannii (5%),
      Enterobacter species (3%), Proteus mirabilis (2%), Serratia marcescens
      (0.6%), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (0.5%). bla(CTX-M) prevalence was 26%,
      24%, and 22% among participating hospitals in the District of Columbia,
      New York, and Florida, respectively. Carbapenemase genes were identified
      in 61 (2%) organisms with the following distribution: bla(KPC) (59%),
      bla(VIM) (16%), bla(OXA) (10%), bla(NDM) (8%), and bla(IMP) (7%). The
      species-specific prevalence of carbapenemase genes was as follows: A.
      baumannii (5%), K. pneumoniae (3%), P. mirabilis (3%), Enterobacter
      species (3%), Citrobacter spp. (3%), P. aeruginosa (2%), E. coli (<1%), K.
      oxytoca (<1%), and S. marcescens (<1%). Approximately 11% of Gram-negative
      organisms in our US cohort contain bla(CTX-M) genes. bla(CTX-M) genes
      remain uncommon in organisms beyond E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and K. oxytoca
      Future molecular diagnostic panels would benefit from the inclusion of
      plasmid-mediated ampC and SHV and TEM extended-spectrum beta-lactamase
      (ESBL) targets.

AB  - Antimicrobial peptides may be alternatives to traditional antibiotics with
      reduced bacterial resistance. The antimicrobial peptide GL13K was derived
      from the salivary protein BPIFA2. This study determined the relative
      activity of the L-and D-enantiomers of GL13K to wild-type and
      drug-resistant strains of three gram-negative species and against
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms. DGL13K displayed in vitro activity
      against extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing and Klebsiella
      pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (MICs 16-32
      μg/ml), MDR and XDR P. aeruginosa, and XDR Acinetobacter baumannii
      carrying metallo-beta-lactamases (MICs 8-32 μg/ml). P. aeruginosa showed
      low inherent resistance to DGL13K and the increased metabolic activity and
      growth caused by sub-MIC concentrations of GL13K peptides did not result
      in acquired bacterial resistance. Daily treatment for approximately two
      weeks did not increase the MIC of DGL13K or cause cross-resistance between
      LGL13K and DGL13K. These data suggest that DGL13K is a promising
      antimicrobial peptide candidate for further development.

AB  - An active, territory-wide, CPE surveillance program implemented from 2011
      showed increasing levels of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae
      (CPE) isolates from patients in Hong Kong hospitals. The molecular
      epidemiology of 567 CPE from patients of three of seven public hospital
      clusters in Hong Kong are described. During a 7-year period, the incidence
      of CPE isolation increased from 0.05 to 9.6/100 000 patient-days. The
      carbapenemase genes identified were polyclonal, including bla(KPC),
      bla(NDM) and bla(IMP), which were mainly associated with hospitalization
      overseas in previous years. However, increasing CPE isolation from
      patients without hospitalization overseas occurred in 2015, with bla(NDM)
      (52.6%) predominant followed by bla(IMP) (30.0%). Escherichia coli (46.4%)
      and Klebsiella spp. (38.3%) were the dominant species. Whole-genome
      sequencing was performed on 169 representative isolates with a combination
      of short and long reads using Illumina and Nanopore technology. Two
      distinct lineages of bla(KPC-2)-positive Klebsiella pneumoniae (ST11 and
      ST258) were identified with ST11 carrying yersiniabactin gene ybt-9 on
      ICEKp3. ST131 E. coli producing IMP-4 was present throughout the study
      period. The bla(NDM) and bla(IMP) genes were mainly carried in IncX3 and
      IncN-ST7 plasmids, respectively. bla(OXA-48-like) gene was carried in the
      IncX3 plasmid in E. coli and in the ColKP3 plasmid in K. pneumoniae. A
      lineage of K. pneumoniae with bla(NDM-1) plus bla(OXA-232) in distinct
      plasmids of IncF1B/IncHI1B was identified and associated with prior
      hospitalization overseas. This study highlights the threat of multiple
      types of CPE, with the predominance of bla(NDM) and bla(IMP) among CPE in
      our hospitals. Enhanced containment strategies are needed to mitigate the
      trend of rapidly rising CPE in healthcare settings.

AB  - KPC-82 is a KPC-2 variant identified in a carbapenem-nonsusceptible
      Citrobacter koseri that confers high-level resistance to
      ceftazidime-avibactam. Genomic analysis revealed that bla(KPC-82) is
      carried by a chromosomally integrated Tn4401 transposon (disrupting porin
      gene phoE) and evolved by a 6-nucleotide tandem repeat duplication causing
      a two-amino-acid insertion (Ser-Asp) within the Ala(267)-Ser(275) loop.
      Similar to related KPC variants, KPC-82 showed decreased carbapenemase
      activity when expressed in a heterologous background and remained
      susceptible to carbapenem/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the epidemiological and
      clinical characteristics of hospitalised patients colonised or infected by
      different types of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) and to
      analyse the differences in their outcome. METHODS: This was a
      retrospective comparative study of all patients colonised or infected by
      KPC-, NDM- or OXA-48-producing CPE who were hospitalised between 1 January
      2018 and 30 June 2019. Microbiological, demographic and clinical data were
      collected from the patients' computerised files. RESULTS: One type of CPE
      was isolated in 285 patients, including 138 with KPC-CPE, 94 with NDM-CPE
      and 53 with OXA-48-CPE. The most common CPE types were KPC-Klebsiella
      pneumoniae (n = 47), OXA-48-Escherichia coli (n = 38), NDM-Enterobacter
      cloacae complex (n = 35) and KPC-Citrobacter freundii (n = 37). All three
      groups of patients were similar with respect to their risk factors, with
      the exception of previous exposure to antimicrobials that was more common
      in patients with KPC-CPE compared with OXA-48-CPE. Also, these patients
      were more likely to be co-infected by other multidrug-resistant bacteria.
      Clinical infections were more common in KPC-CPE than in OXA-48-CPE
      carriers (9.9% vs. 1.9%; P = 0.033). No other demographic or clinical
      variables were found to be correlated with clinical infections.
      CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that colonisation by OXA-48-CPE might be
      less risky compared with KPC-CPE.

AB  - Meropenem-vaborbactam is a fixed-dose beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor
      with potent in vitro and in vivo activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Enterobacterales.
      Pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) target attainment analyses were
      undertaken using population pharmacokinetic models, nonclinical PK-PD
      targets for efficacy, in vitro surveillance data, and simulation to
      provide support for 2 g meropenem-2 g vaborbactam every 8 h (q8h)
      administered as a 3-h intravenous (i.v.) infusion, and dosing regimens
      adjusted for patients with renal impairment. Simulated patients varying by
      renal function measure (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR],
      mL/min/1.73 m(2) and absolute eGFR, mL/min) and resembling the clinical
      trial population (complicated urinary tract infection, including acute
      pyelonephritis) were generated. The PK-PD targets for meropenem, the
      percentage of time on day 1 that free-drug plasma concentrations were

      ratio), were calculated. Percent probabilities of achieving meropenem
      free-drug plasma %T>MIC and vaborbactam free-drug plasma AUC:MIC ratio
      targets were assessed. MIC distributions for Enterobacterales,
      KPC-producing Enterobacterales, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were considered
      as part of an algorithm to assess PK-PD target attainment. For assessments
      of free-drug plasma PK-PD targets associated with a 1-log(10) CFU
      reduction from baseline, percent probabilities of PK-PD target attainment
      ranged from 81.3 to 100% at meropenem-vaborbactam MIC values of 4 or 8
      μg/mL among simulated patients. The results of these PK-PD target
      attainment analyses provide support for a dosing regimen of 2 g
      meropenem-2 g vaborbactam q8h administered as a 3-h i.v. infusion, with
      dosing regimens adjusted for patients with renal impairment and a
      meropenem-vaborbactam susceptibility breakpoint of ≤8 μg/mL (tested with a
      fixed vaborbactam concentration of 8 μg/mL) for Enterobacterales and P.
      aeruginosa based on these dosing regimens.

AB  - The emergence and spread of antimicrobial resistance pose a threat to
      public health globally. Antibiotic-resistant bacteria and genes can
      disseminate among environments, animals and humans. Therefore,
      investigation into potential reservoirs of multidrug-resistant bacteria is
      of great importance to the understanding of putative transmission routes
      of resistant bacteria and resistance genes. This study aimed to report the
      occurrence of Escherichia coli harboring the Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenemase-producing gene (bla(KPC)) in Psittaciformes rescued from
      wildlife trafficking in Paraíba State, Brazil. Cloacal swabs were
      collected from thirty birds and cultured by conventional microbiology
      using MacConkey and serum tryptone glucose glycerol (STGG) media
      supplemented with selective antimicrobials. E. coli isolates (n = 43) were
      identified by phenotypic tests and confirmed by MALDI-TOF. Antimicrobial
      susceptibility profiles were determined by means of Kirby-Bauer test. All
      isolates were further screened for extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)
      production, and putative genes encoding ESBL were investigated by PCR.
      Additionally, bla(KPC)-harboring strains were genotyped by REP-PCR. A
      total of 43 E. coli phenotypically resistant isolates were recovered. The
      highest resistance rate was observed against ciprofloxacin. Among the
      resistance genes, only bla(KPC) was found in seven different birds from
      three species. According to the genotyping, these seven isolates belonged
      to four different strains. To date, this is the first report on the
      occurrence of KPC-E. coli in Psittaciformes rescued from trafficking in
      Northeastern Brazil. Due to the high clinical importance of KPC-E. coli,
      our findings suggest that wild animals in captivity at wildlife rescue
      centers can play a role as reservoirs of bacteria that are resistance to
      Critically Important antimicrobials in human medicine.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPC-2 and KPC-3) present a global
      clinical threat, as these β-lactamases confer resistance to carbapenems
      and oxyimino-cephalosporins. Recent clinically identified KPC variants
      with substitutions at Ambler position D179, located in the Ω loop, are
      resistant to the β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor combination
      ceftazidime-avibactam, but susceptible to meropenem-vaborbactam. To gain
      insights into ceftazidime-avibactam resistance conferred by D179N/Y
      variants of KPC-2, crystal structures of these variants were determined.
      The D179N KPC-2 structure revealed that the change of the carboxyl to an
      amide moiety at position 179 disrupted the salt bridge with R164 present
      in wild-type KPC-2. Additional interactions were disrupted in the Ω loop,
      causing a decrease in the melting temperature. Shifts originating from
      N179 were also transmitted toward the active site, including ∼1-Å shifts
      of the deacylation water and interacting residue N170. The structure of
      the D179Y KPC-2 β-lactamase revealed more drastic changes, as this variant
      exhibited disorder of the Ω loop, with other flanking regions also being
      disordered. We postulate that the KPC-2 variants can accommodate
      ceftazidime because the Ω loop is displaced in D179Y or can be more
      readily displaced in D179N KPC-2. To understand why the β-lactamase
      inhibitor vaborbactam is less affected by the D179 variants than
      avibactam, we determined the crystal structure of D179N KPC-2 in complex
      with vaborbactam, which revealed wild-type KPC-2-like vaborbactam-active
      site interactions. Overall, the structural results regarding KPC-2 D179
      variants revealed various degrees of destabilization of the Ω loop that
      contribute to ceftazidime-avibactam resistance, possible
      substrate-assisted catalysis of ceftazidime, and meropenem and
      meropenem-vaborbactam susceptibility.

AB  - Colistin resistance in Gram negative bacteria is mainly attributed to
      chromosomal mutations in Two Component Systems(TCS) PhoPQ and PmrAB and
      plasmid-borne genes(mcr and its variants). The aim of this study was to
      understand the molecular basis of colistin resistance in Klebsiella
      pneumoniae and determine clonal transmission, in a North Indian tertiary
      care hospital over a 2.5 year period. Antimicrobial susceptibility was
      determined by Vitek and colistin resistance was confirmed by broth
      microdilution. Carbapenemases(bla(KPC), bla(VIM), bla(IMP), bla(NDM),
      bla(OXA-48)) and mcr-1 screening was done by PCR. Mutations in chromosomal
      genes mgrB, phoP, phoQ, pmrA, pmrB were analysed. Sequence typing was
      performed by Multilocus sequence typing(MLST). OXA-48 was detected in
      thirteen isolates while three isolates co-expressed OXA-48 and NDM. The
      mcr-1 gene was absent in all 16 isolates. Deleterious mutations in mgrB
      included insertion sequences IS903 and ISkpn26 and a premature stop codon.
      A total of 18 point mutations were identified in PhoPQ and PmrAB TCS; of
      which, novel mutations were reported in phoQ (K46E, L322V, D152N, F373L,
      R249G), pmrB (P159R) and pmrA (D149L). Six different sequence types ST231,
      ST147, ST395, ST42, ST14 and ST101 were identified. Phylogenetic analysis
      showed that sequence types ST14, ST395 and ST147 are closely related to
      ST101 and all identified sequence types had a common ancestor ST231.
      Colistin resistance in K. pneumoniae was attributed to mutations in PhoPQ
      and PmrAB TCS, while location specific distribution of strains indicates
      clonal transmission. The results of this study will help in formulation of
      effective infection prevention and antimicrobial development strategies.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC-2) is the most commonly
      encountered class A β-lactamase variant worldwide, which confer high-level
      resistance to most available antibiotics. In this article we address the
      issue by a combined approach involving molecular dynamics simulations and
      hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics calculations. The study
      contributes to improve the understanding, at molecular level, of the
      acylation and deacylation stages of avibactam involved in the inhibition
      of KPC-2. The results show that both mechanisms, acylation and
      deacylation, the reaction occur via the formation of a tetrahedral
      intermediate. The formation of this intermediate corresponds to the rate
      limiting stage. The activation barriers are 19.5 kcal/mol and 23.0
      kcal/mol for the acylation and deacylation stages, respectively. The
      associated rate constants calculated, using the Eyring equation, are 1.2 ×
      10(-1) and 3.9 × 10(-4) (s(-1)). These values allow estimating a value of
      3.3 × 10(-3) for the inhibition constant, in good agreement with the
      experimental value.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to compare clinical outcomes of patients with
      Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Enterobacterales and
      those with New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM)-producing Enterobacterales.
      METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort study of all adult patients
      with KPC- or NDM-producing Enterobacterales isolates in a 2700-bed
      tertiary referral hospital in Seoul, South Korea, between 2010 and 2019.
      The primary outcome was 30-day mortality after first isolation of KPC- or
      NDM-producing Enterobacterales. The secondary outcome was the development
      of infection within 30 days by the colonizing isolates, among colonized
      patients. We performed Cox regression analysis for 30-day mortality and
      competing risk analysis for development of infection. RESULTS: A total of
      859 patients were identified during the study period; 475 (55%) had KPC
      and 384 (45%) had NDM. Thirty-day mortality was significantly higher in
      the KPC group than in the NDM group (17% (81/475) vs 9% (33/384); p <
      0.001). The KPC group developed infection within 30 days from the initial
      colonization after first isolation more frequently than the NDM group (8%
      (27/353) vs. 3% (10/295); p 0.02). Multivariable analysis revealed that
      independent risk factors for 30-day mortality were solid cancer (adjusted
      hazard ratio (aHR) 2.51; 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.66-3.79; p <
      0.001), solid organ transplant (aHR 0.32; 95% CI 0.17-0.61; p < 0.001), a
      high APACHE II score (aHR 1.11; 95% CI 1.08-1.13; p < 0.001),
      KPC-producing Enterobacterales (aHR 1.69; 95% CI 1.02-2.79; p 0.04),
      previous carbapenem use within 3 months (aHR 1.86; 95% CI 1.26-2.75; p <
      0.001) and site of KPC- or NDM-producing Enterobacterales infection at the
      time of the first culture (p < 0.001). DISCUSSION: Our study suggests that
      KPC-producing Enterobacterales is significantly associated with poorer
      outcomes than NDM-producing Enterobacterales.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to characterise all carbapenemase-producing
      enterobacteria (CPE) isolates obtained from an outbreak-free setting in
      Uruguay. METHODS: We studied 12 CPE isolated from Hospital de Clínicas
      between 2012-2016. Bacterial identification and antibiotic susceptibility
      testing were performed using VITEK®2 and Sensititre or agar dilution,
      respectively. Antimicrobial resistance genes and mobile genetic elements
      were identified by PCR and sequencing. Multilocus sequence typing was
      performed for Klebsiella pneumoniae. Plasmid conjugation was assessed,
      plasmid size was estimated by S1-PFGE and plasmid incompatibility groups
      were sought by PCR. RESULTS: Among 8364 enterobacteria, 12 CPE were
      isolated from urine, blood culture, wound, peritoneal fluid and punch
      samples. NDM-1 was the most prevalent carbapenemase, followed by VIM-2 and
      KPC-2. All isolates were resistant to gentamicin, cefotaxime, ceftazidime,
      trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, ciprofloxacin and imipenem and were
      susceptible to fosfomycin. We characterised six class 1 integrons:
      dfrA12-orfF-aadA2; aacA4-bla(OXA-2)-orfD; aadB-aadA2; dfrA1;
      aadB-bla(OXA-10)-aadA1; and bla(VIM-2)-dfrA7. An association between
      various aminoglycoside, β-lactam and fluoroquinolone resistance genes were
      observed, some of them located in transferable plasmids belonging to
      incompatibility groups IncC, IncHI1 and IncM1. We described a new
      composite transposon (assigned Tn6935) including bla(NDM-1) flanked by two
      directly-oriented copies of a Tn3-like element ISKox2-like family
      transposase. The sequence types of K. pneumoniae isolates were ST11, ST14
      and ST661. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of CPE is sporadic and could be due
      to measures taken by the Public Health Committee. Nevertheless, the
      coexistence of several resistance mechanisms and their presence in
      conjugative plasmids and high-risk clones is worrisome.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: No-touch disinfection systems like xenon- or mercury-based
      ultraviolet (UV) are now commonly being used for hospital room
      disinfection. However, serial exposure to UV light can potentially lead to
      the development of bacterial resistance. We sought to determine whether UV
      resistance develops due to serial exposure to UV light using 3
      epidemiologically important multidrug-resistant microbial strains.
      METHODS: Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA),
      carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC) and
      metallo-β-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (MBL) were serially
      exposed to 25 growth-irradiation cycles of UV produced by a xenon-based UV
      (Xe-UV) lamp for 5 minutes or a mercury-based UV (Hg-UV) lamp for 10
      minutes. After each UV exposure cycle, the surviving colony-forming units
      (CFUs) were measured and compared with the initial inoculum of each cycle
      for each strain, respectively. RESULTS: In each cycle, ˜1-10 million of
      MRSA, KPC, and MBL were used to test the effect of UV irradiation.
      Postexposure colony counts remained low (3-100 colonies) throughout the 25
      serial exposures to both xenon- and mercury-based UV. The log-kill rate
      after each exposure showed no changes following UV disinfection by Xe-UV.
      The MRSA log-kill rate increased after repeated exposure to Hg-UV unlike
      KPC and MBL K. pneumoniae, which did not change. Whole-genome sequencing
      (WGS) analyses performed on these 3 strains demonstrated no significant
      genetic changes after multiple UV irradiation cycles. CONCLUSIONS:
      Exposure of multidrug-resistant bacteria to UV produced from 2 different
      UV sources did not engender UV resistance after 25 serial exposures, as
      demonstrated by WGS analysis; thus, UV disinfection is unlikely to
      generate UV-resistant hospital flora.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The discovery of new molecules with antimicrobial properties
      has been a promising approach, mainly when related to substances produced
      by bacteria. The use of substances produced by bees has evidenced the
      antimicrobial action in different types of organisms. Thus, the use of
      bacteria isolated from larval food of stingless bees opens the way for the
      identification of the new molecules. The effect of supernatants produced
      by these bacteria was evaluated for their ability to inhibit the growth of
      bacteria of clinical interest. Furthermore, their effects were evaluated
      when used in synergy with antibiotics available in the pharmaceutical
      industry. RESULTS: A few supernatants showed an inhibitory effect against
      susceptible and multiresistant strains in the PIC assay and the modulation
      assay. Emphasizing the inhibitory effect on multidrug-resistant strains, 7
      showed an effect on multidrug-resistant Escherichia coli (APEC),
      Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa, and multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in the
      PIC assay. Of the supernatants analyzed, some presented synergism for more
      than one species of multidrug-resistant bacteria. Nine had a synergistic
      effect with ampicillin on E. coli (APEC) or S. aureus (MRSA), 5 with
      penicillin G on E. coli (APEC) or KPC, and 3 with vancomycin on KPC.
      CONCLUSION: In summary, the results indicate that supernatants produced
      from microorganisms can synthesize different classes of molecules with
      potent antibiotic activity against multiresistant bacteria. Thus,
      suggesting the use of these microorganisms for use clinical tests to
      isolate the molecules produced and their potential for use.

AB  - KPC-producing K. pneumoniae is an endemic challenge. Seven KPC-producing
      Enterobacterales showed unusual carbapenems susceptibility profile. These
      strains were resistance at least one carbapenem and the ertapenem MIC was
      lower than imipenem and/or meropenem MICs using Vitek 2™ system
      (bioMerieux). When E-test™ and disk diffusion methods were performed the
      carbapenems showed susceptible results.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Here we describe an IncQ1-like plasmid carrying bla(KPC-2) in
      a new non-Tn4401 element found in Citrobacter werkmanii recovered from
      coastal water. METHODS: In vitro and in silico approaches were used to
      assess antimicrobial resistance determinants, as well as bla(KPC-2)
      vicinities. RESULTS: The LB-887 isolate showed a multidrug-resistant
      phenotype and was identified as C. werkmanii. Resistome analysis
      identified further acquired resistance determinants to β-lactams,
      aminoglycosides, sulphonamides/trimethoprim, tetracyclines,
      chloramphenicol, macrolides, rifampicin and fluoroquinolones. Plasmidome
      included incompatibility groups IncA, IncC2, IncR, Col and IncQ families.
      The bla(KPC-2) was inserted on a new variant of NTE(KPC)-II, called here
      NTE(KPC)-IIe, carried by an InQ1-like plasmid of 7930 kb (pKPC-LB887).
      NTE(KPC)-IIe differed from NTE(KPC)-IId by the complete absence of
      ISKpn6-tnpA. The InQ1-like backbone harbouring this element had been
      described in Enterobacterales recovered from clinical and environmental
      settings. CONCLUSION: Unravelling genetic structures related to bla(KPC)
      dissemination in different settings may provide clues on the main forces
      driving evolution of this important resistance determinant. Indeed, the
      occurrence of bla(KPC) in a new NTE(KPC) variant from an environmental
      source highlights the ongoing evolution of this mobile genetic element. In
      addition, bla(KPC) carriage on a small and highly mobilizable IncQ plasmid
      in C. freundii complex from recreational water, similar to others found in
      clinical isolates, may suggest its relevance for bla(KPC-2) dissemination
      among different compartments.

AB  - Currently, the mortality rate in Saudi Arabia's ICUs is increasing due to
      the spread of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing
      bacteria. This study was carried out to evaluate the ability of
      biologically synthesized zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO-NPs) using
      Aspergillus niger to overcome carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (KPC) in
      vitro and in vivo. ZnO-NPs were synthesized via a biological method and
      characterized using UV-Vis spectroscopy, Zetasizer and zeta potential
      analyses, x-ray diffraction spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared
      spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy-dispersive
      x-ray spectroscopy (EDX). In vitro sensitivity of KPC to ZnO-NPs was
      identified using the well diffusion method. The minimum inhibitory
      concentration (MIC) and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were
      determined by a macro-dilution method. The morphological alteration of KPC
      cells after ZnO-NPs treatment was observed by SEM. The in vivo
      susceptibility of KPC cells to ZnO-NPs ointment was evaluated using wound
      healing in experimental rats. The chemical characterization findings
      showed the formation, stability, shape, and size of the synthesized
      nanoparticles. The MIC and MBC were 0.7 and 1.8 mg/ml, respectively. The
      in vivo results displayed reduced inflammation and wound
      re-epithelialization of KPC-infected rats. These findings demonstrated
      that ZnO-NPs have great potential to be developed as antibacterial agents.

AB  - Ceftazidime/avibactam is a new enzyme inhibitor combination medication
      composed of ceftazidime and avibactam. It forms an enzyme-inhibitor
      complex by covalently binding β-lactamase, which can effectively restore
      the antibacterial activity of ceftazidime against a variety of
      carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae strains, covering Klebsiella
      pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella
      pneumonia (CRKP) and other common drug-resistant gram-negative bacteria
      infections. The related issues of anti-infective effects of
      ceftazidime/avibactam on lung infections, abdominal infections,
      bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections and other different
      infections were discussed in this article. The clinical safety and

AB  - BACKGROUND: Bloodstream infections (BSI) by multidrug-resistant (MDR)
      organisms are responsible for significant mortality in critically ill
      trauma patients. Our objective is to identify the risk factors for BSI by
      MDR agents and their resistance mechanisms in a trauma reference hospital.
      METHODS: During 18 months, all patients admitted in our Intensive Care
      Unit (ICU) were enrolled in this prospective cohort. We included the first
      episode of BSI by carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria,
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and vancomycin
      resistant enterococcus. Demographic and clinical data were compared among
      patients with and without BSI and variables with P < .05 were tested in a
      multivariate analysis. We performed PCR for identification of
      carbapenemase and SCC mec genes and Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis for
      clonality. RESULTS: Out of 1,528 patients, 302 (19.8%) were trauma and 66
      (4.3%) had a MDR-BSI (19.5% were trauma). The multivariate analysis showed
      that mechanical ventilation (OR3.16; 95% CI 1-8; P = .02), hemodialysis
      (OR3.16; 95% CI 1-5; P = .0003) and surgery (OR1.76; 95% CI 1-3; P = .04)
      were independent risk factors for MDR-BSI. The most frequent MDR were
      Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 26) and MRSA (n = 27). Regarding K pneumoniae
      strains (n = 24), 20 (83.8%) harbored bla KPC gene and 1 bla NDM. The
      majority of KPC isolates belonged to a predominant clone; while the MRSA
      were polyclonal and SCC mec type II. CONCLUSIONS: Mechanical ventilation,
      surgery and hemodialysis were independent risk factors for MDR-BSI in our
      cohort, but trauma was not. KPC was the main mechanism of resistance among
      carbapenem-resistant K pneumoniae that belonged to a predominant clone
      which could indicate cross-transmission.

      infection and/or colonization of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales
      (CPE) based on clinical and microbiological data for patients in the
      intensive care unit (ICU). All patients admitted to medical ICU were
      screened for CPE on admission and weekly, and this 1:2 case-control study
      included patients with CPE identified by screening or clinical cultures
      from 2017 to 2018. The clonal relatedness was evaluated by pulsed-field
      gel electrophoresis (PFGE). A total of 45 CPE patients were identified
      with a prevalence of 3.8%. The most frequent organism was Klebsiella
      pneumoniae (69%) and the carbapenemases belonged to the class A Klebsiella
      pneumoniae Carbapenemase (KPC-2) (87%), class B New Delhi
      Metallo-β-lactamase (NDM) (11%), and Imipenemase (IMP-1) (2%) strains. The
      PFGE profiles showed two large clustered groups of KPC-2-producing K.
      pneumoniae. In the multivariate analysis, pneumonia/chronic pulmonary
      disease, previous fluoroquinolone use, and previous use of nasogastric
      tube were the significant risk factors for CPE infection or colonization
      in ICU-admitted patients. Critical illness and underlying medical
      conditions such as pneumonia/chronic pulmonary disease, antimicrobial
      selective pressure, and the use of a medical device are identified as risk
      factors for CPE infection or colonization in ICU. Person to person
      transmission also contributed.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing sequence
      type (ST) 463 Pseudomonas aeruginosa are increasingly prevalent in China.
      This study aims to investigate how bla(KPC-2) is acquired in ST463 P.
      aeruginosa during antimicrobial therapy. METHODS: Two extensively
      drug-resistant P. aeruginosa strains, B1122 and U1121, were respectively
      isolated from blood and urine of a patient during carbapenem therapy.
      Whole-genome sequences were obtained, and minimum inhibitory
      concentrations (MICs) were determined. Plasmid transferability and
      stability were examined. Bacterial growth kinetics, biofilm formation, and
      virulence level was assessed. RESULTS: U1121 and B1122 were only
      susceptible to amikacin and intermediately susceptible to colistin. They
      were isogenic ST463 P. aeruginosa strains and shared the same
      chromosome-encoded resistance genes, including bla(AFM-1). This is the
      first report of chromosomal integration of bla(AFM-1) in P. aeruginosa
      mediated by ISCR29. pU1121 and pB1122, which shared almost identical
      backbone, were the sole plasmids in U1121 and B1122, respectively,
      differing by an insertion region containing two copies of bla(KPC-2) genes
      observed on pU1121. Sequence alignment revealed that pU1121 might evolve
      in vivo from pB1122 via IS26-mediated continuous genetic rearrangement in
      response to selective challenge from carbapenem. pU1121 was not
      self-transmissible and could be stably maintained in the host in the
      absence of antibiotic. Both U1121 and B1122 were hypervirulent, and no
      differences on virulence were recorded between them. However, U1121
      exhibited significant impaired growth in comparison with B1122.
      CONCLUSION: ST463 P. aeruginosa can capture bla(KPC-2) through horizontal
      transfer of insertion sequence under antibiotic selection pressure, which
      does decrease the fitness but does not impair the virulence of the
      ancestor.

AB  - Introduction. Increasing numbers of carbapenemase-producing
      Enterobacterales (CPE), which can be challenging to treat, have been
      referred to the national reference laboratory in England since the early
      2000s.Gap Statement/Aim. Previous studies on CPE in the UK have focussed
      on localized outbreaks. We applied whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to
      isolates referred to the national reference laboratory over 30 months to
      inform our understanding of CPE epidemiology in England.Methodology. The
      first confirmed CPE from each new patient referred by an English
      diagnostic laboratory between 1 January 2014 and 30 June 2016 was
      sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500. Multiple isolates from the same
      patient were included from either different species or the same species
      with different carbapenemase genes. The data were analysed using an
      in-house bioinformatics pipeline that determines species identification,
      multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) profile and antimicrobial resistance
      gene content.Results. A total of 2658 non-duplicate CPE were sequenced
      amongst which three host organisms belonging to diverse sequence types
      (STs) predominated: Klebsiella pneumoniae (1380/2658, 51.9 %; 177 STs),
      Escherichia coli (723/2658, 27.2 %; 133 STs) and Enterobacter cloacae
      (294/2658, 11.1 %; 88 STs). Thirty different carbapenemase gene variants
      were identified, although bla (OXA-48-like) (1122/2658, 42.2%), bla (NDM)
      (692/2658, 26.0 %), bla (KPC) (571/2658, 21.5 %), bla (VIM) (100/2658, 3.8
      %) and bla (IMP) (33/2658, 1.2 %) predominated. ST/carbapenemase gene
      pairings represented widely distributed high-risk clones or clusters at a
      regional or hospital level.Conclusion. CPE referred to the national
      reference laboratory are diverse, suggesting multiple introductions to
      England and a role for horizontal transfer of carbapenemase genes in
      English CPE epidemiology.

AB  - To estimate the incidence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE),
      a global collection of 81,781 surveillance isolates of Enterobacterales
      collected from patients in 39 countries in five geographic regions from
      2012 to 2017 was studied. Overall, 3.3% of isolates were
      meropenem-nonsusceptible (MIC ≥2 μg/ml), ranging from 1.4% (North America)
      to 5.3% (Latin America) of isolates by region. Klebsiella pneumoniae
      accounted for the largest number of meropenem-nonsusceptible isolates
      (76.7%). The majority of meropenem-nonsusceptible Enterobacterales carried
      KPC-type carbapenemases (47.4%), metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs; 20.6%) or
      OXA-48-like β-lactamases (19.0%). Forty-three carbapenemase sequence
      variants (8 KPC-type, 4 GES-type, 7 OXA-48-like, 5 NDM-type, 7 IMP-type,
      and 12 VIM-type) were detected, with KPC-2, KPC-3, OXA-48, NDM-1, IMP-4,
      and VIM-1 identified as the most common variants of each carbapenemase
      type. The resistance mechanisms responsible for
      meropenem-nonsusceptibility varied by region. A total of 67.3% of all
      carbapenemase-positive isolates identified carried at least one additional
      plasmid-mediated or intrinsic chromosomally encoded extended-spectrum
      β-lactamase, AmpC β-lactamase, or carbapenemase. The overall percentage of
      meropenem-nonsusceptible Enterobacterales increased from 2.7% in 2012 to
      2014 to 3.8% in 2015 to 2017. This increase could be attributed to the
      increasing proportion of carbapenemase-positive isolates that was
      observed, most notably among isolates carrying NDM-type MBLs in Asia/South
      Pacific, Europe, and Latin America; OXA-48-like carbapenemases in Europe,
      Middle East/Africa, and Asia/South Pacific; VIM-type MBLs in Europe; and
      KPC-type carbapenemases in Latin America. Ongoing CRE surveillance
      combined with a global antimicrobial stewardship strategy, sensitive
      clinical laboratory detection methods, and adherence to infection control

      In Vitro Activity of Meropenem against Carbapenem-Resistant

AB  - Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) are an urgent threat to
      public health requiring the development of novel therapies. TP0586532 is a
      novel non-hydroxamate LpxC inhibitor that inhibits the synthesis of
      lipopolysaccharides, which are components of the outer membranes of
      Gram-negative bacteria. Based on the mechanism of action of TP0586532, we
      hypothesized that it might enhance the antibacterial activity of other
      antibiotics by increasing the permeability of the outer bacterial
      membrane. The combination of TP0586532 with meropenem, amikacin, cefepime,
      piperacillin, and tigecycline showed synergistic and additive effects
      against carbapenem-susceptible Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli.
      Checkerboard experiments against 21 carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae and
      E. coli strains (13 bla(KPC)+, 5 bla(NDM-1)+, 2 bla(VIM)+, and 1
      bla(IMP)+) showed that the combination of TP0586532 with meropenem yielded
      synergistic and additive effects against 9 and 12 strains, respectively.
      In a time-kill assay examining 12 CRE strains, synergistic effects were
      observed when TP0586532 was combined with meropenem against many of the
      strains. A membrane permeability assay using ethidium bromide (EtBr) was
      performed to investigate the mechanism of the potentiating effect.
      TP0586532 increased the influx of EtBr into a CRE strain, suggesting that
      TP0586532 increased membrane permeability and facilitated intracellular
      access for the antibiotics. Our study demonstrates that TP0586532
      potentiates the in vitro antibacterial activity of meropenem against CRE.
      Combination therapy consisting of TP0586532 and meropenem has potential as
      a treatment for CRE infections. IMPORTANCE Carbapenem-resistant
      Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) are an urgent public health threat, as
      therapeutic options are limited. TP0586532 is a novel LpxC inhibitor that
      inhibits the synthesis of lipopolysaccharides in the outer membranes of
      Gram-negative bacteria. Here, we demonstrated the potentiating effects of
      TP0586532 on the antibacterial activity of meropenem against CRE harboring
      various types of carbapenemase genes (bla(KPC)+, bla(NDM-1)+ bla(VIM)+,
      and bla(IMP)+). TP0586532 also augmented the bactericidal effects of
      meropenem against CRE strains, even against those with a high level of
      resistance to meropenem. The potentiating effects were suggested to be
      mediated by an increase in bacterial membrane permeability. Our study
      revealed that a combination therapy consisting of TP0586532 and meropenem
      has the potential to be a novel therapeutic option for CRE infections.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The increasing number of carbapenemase-producing
      Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) has become a global problem. Most carbapenemases
      detected in Japan are imipenemase, which is an imipenem-degrading enzyme
      with low ability; thus, CPE could have been overlooked. Therefore, this
      study aimed to detect and analyze CPE, without overlooking CPE showing the
      low minimum inhibitory concentration phenotype. METHODS: CPE screening was
      conducted on 531 ceftazidime-resistant Enterobacteriaceae isolated from
      Kitasato University Hospital during 2006-2015. We confirmed the presence
      of the carbapenemase genes (bla(IMP), bla(VIM), bla(KPC), bla(NDM), and
      bla(OXA-48)) by multiplex polymerase chain reaction. The detected CPE
      strains were analyzed by antimicrobial susceptibility testing, multilocus
      sequence typing, conjugal experiments, replicon typing, and plasmid
      profiling by restriction enzyme treatment. RESULTS: The CPE detection rate
      in Kitasato University Hospital within the past 10 years was 0.0003% (nine
      CPE strains). These nine CPE strains were identified to harbor 8
      bla(IMP-1) or 1 bla(NDM-5). The CPE strains consisted of five species
      including Klebsiella pneumoniae and Citrobacter freundii. Six of eight
      bla(IMP-1) were coded by IncHI2 plasmid, and the other two were coded by
      IncA/C plasmid. Plasmid profiling revealed that K. pneumoniae and C.
      freundii isolated from the same patient harbored the same plasmid.
      CONCLUSION: The CPE detection rate in this study was significantly lower
      than those previously reported in Japan. In one case, IncA/C plasmid
      transmission through different bacterial species within the body was
      speculated. Although the number of CPE detected was low, these results
      indicated that the resistance plasmid could spread to other bacterial
      species.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Piperacillin/tazobactam has long been a broad-spectrum
      'workhorse' antibiotic; however, it is compromised by resistance. One
      response is to re-partner tazobactam with cefepime, which is easier to
      protect, being less β-lactamase labile, and to use a high-dose and
      prolonged infusion. On this basis, Wockhardt are developing
      cefepime/tazobactam (WCK 4282) as a 2+2 g q8h combination with a 90-min
      infusion. METHODS: The activity of cc cefepime/tazobactam was assessed,
      with other tazobactam combinations as comparators, against 1632
      Enterobacterales, 745 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 450 other non-fermenters,
      as submitted to the UK National Reference Laboratory. These were
      categorised by carbapenemase-gene detection and interpretive reading of
      phenotypes, with MICs determined by British Society for Antimicrobial
      Chemotherapy agar dilution. RESULTS: Although higher breakpoints may be
      justifiable, based on the pharmacodynamics, the results were reviewed
      against current cefepime criteria. On this basis, cefepime/tazobactam was
      broadly active against Enterobacterales with AmpC enzymes and
      extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), even when they had ertapenem
      resistance, suggesting porin loss. At 8+8 mg/L, activity extended to > 90%
      of Enterobacterales with OXA-48 and KPC carbapenemases, although the MICs
      for KPC producers belonging to the international Klebsiella pneumoniae
      ST258 lineage were higher; metallo-β-lactamase producers remained
      resistant. Cefepime/tazobactam was less active than ceftolozane/tazobactam
      against Pseudomonas aeruginosa with AmpC de-repression or high-level
      efflux but achieved wider antipseudomonal coverage than
      piperacillin/tazobactam. Activity against other non-fermenters was
      species-specific. CONCLUSION: Overall, cefepime/tazobactam had a spectrum
      exceeding those of piperacillin/tazobactam and ceftolozane/tazobactam and
      resembling or exceeding that of carbapenems. Used as a 'new-combination of
      old-agents' it has genuine potential to be 'carbapenem-sparing'.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In response to increasing numbers of carbapenemase-producing
      Enterobacterales (CPE) in England, Public Health England (PHE) launched an
      electronic reporting system (ERS) for the enhanced surveillance of
      carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative bacteria. Our study aimed to
      describe system engagement and the epidemiology of CPE in England.
      METHODS: Engagement with the ERS was assessed by calculating the
      proportion of referrals submitted this system. ERS data were extracted and
      cases defined as patients with CPE isolated from a screening or clinical
      specimen in England between 1(st) May 2015 to 31(st) March 2019.
      Descriptive summary statistics for each variable were prepared. RESULTS:
      The ERS processed 12,656 suspected CPE reports. Uptake of the ERS by local
      microbiology laboratories varied, with approximately 70% of referrals made
      via the ERS by April 2016; this steadily decreased after March 2018.
      Six-thousand eight-hundred and fifty-seven cases were included in the
      analysis. Most cases were from colonised patients (80.6%) rather than
      infected, and the majority were inpatients in acute hospital settings
      (87.3%). Carbapenemases were most frequently detected in Klebsiella
      pneumoniae (39.1%) and Escherichia coli (30.3%). The most frequently
      identified carbapenemase families were OXA-48-like (45.1%) and KPC
      (26.4%). Enhanced data variables were poorly completed. CONCLUSIONS: The
      ERS has provided some insight into the epidemiology of CPE in England. An
      increasing number of routine diagnostic laboratories have introduced
      methods to routinely identify acquired carbapenemases and PHE has modified
      its approach to ensure robust surveillance, which is an essential aspect
      of an effective response to prevent and control the spread of CPE.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Imipenem/relebactam is a novel carbapenem/β-lactamase
      inhibitor combination, developed to act against carbapenemase-producing
      Enterobacterales (CPE). OBJECTIVES: To assess the in vitro activity of
      imipenem/relebactam against a Spanish nationwide collection of CPE by
      testing the susceptibility of these isolates to 16 widely used
      antimicrobials and to determine the underlying β-lactam resistance
      mechanisms involved and the molecular epidemiology of carbapenemases in
      Spain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical CPE isolates (n = 401) collected
      for 2 months from 24 hospitals in Spain were tested. MIC50, MIC90 and
      susceptibility/resistance rates were interpreted in accordance with the
      EUCAST guidelines. β-Lactam resistance mechanisms and molecular
      epidemiology were characterized by WGS. RESULTS: For all isolates, high
      rates of susceptibility to colistin (86.5%; MIC50/90 = 0.12/8 mg/L),
      imipenem/relebactam (85.8%; MIC50/90 = 0.5/4 mg/L) and
      ceftazidime/avibactam (83.8%, MIC50/90 = 1/≥256 mg/L) were observed. The
      subgroups of isolates producing OXA-48-like (n = 305, 75.1%) and KPC-like
      enzymes (n = 44, 10.8%) were highly susceptible to ceftazidime/avibactam
      (97.7%, MIC50/90 = 1/2 mg/L) and imipenem/relebactam (100.0%, MIC50/90 =
      ≤0.25/1 mg/L), respectively.The most widely disseminated high-risk clones
      of carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae across Spain were found
      to be ST11, ST147, ST392 and ST15 (mostly associated with OXA-48) and
      ST258/512 (in all cases producing KPC). CONCLUSIONS: Imipenem/relebactam,
      colistin and ceftazidime/avibactam were the most active antimicrobials
      against all CPEs. Imipenem/relebactam is a valuable addition to the
      antimicrobial arsenal used in the fight against CPE, particularly against
      KPC-producing isolates, which in all cases were susceptible to this
      combination.

AB  - Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella michiganensis (CRKM) and Klebsiella
      oxytoca (CRKO) strains have occasionally been reported to cause severe
      infections. However, SIM-producing K. michiganensis strains have never
      been described. In this study, we phenotypically and genetically
      characterized 6 CRKM and CRKO strains isolated over the past 10 years at a
      Chinese tertiary hospital. All six strains were positive for the mCIM
      test, and five were positive for the MBL test. Carbapenemase-encoding
      genes (bla(KPC), bla(NDM), bla(VIM), bla(IMP), bla(OXA-23), bla(OXA-24),
      bla(OXA-51), and bla(OXA-58)) and another 12 resistance genes were
      screened by PCR, and bla(KPC), bla(NDM), and bla(IMP) were identified in
      five strains. However, the CRKM strain KM41, which was resistant to IPM
      and MEM with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of 4 µg/ml and 16
      µg/ml, respectively, had positive mCIM and MBL results but lacked the
      eight carbapenemase-encoding genes. Whole-genome sequencing of the KM41
      strain revealed more than 20 drug resistance genes; in particular,
      bla(SIM-1), bla(OXA-1), bla(CTX-M-14), qnrS, aac(6')-Ib-cr, aadA17, and
      aar-3 were found to be located in a single plasmid. To the best of our
      knowledge, this is the first description of a K. michiganensis strain
      coharboring bla(SIM-1), bla(OXA-1), bla(CTX-M-14), qnrS, and aac(6')-Ib-cr

AB  - The gastrointestinal tract is an important reservoir of extended spectrum
      beta-lactamase (ESBL)/carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales isolates.
      This study included patients from two Bulgarian hospitals. Overall, 98
      ESBL producers (including 68 Escherichia coli and 20 Klebsiella pneumoniae
      isolates) were detected among 99 hospitalized patients, 212 patients at
      admission, and 92 hospital staff in 42.4%, 24.5%, and 4%, respectively. We
      observed bla(CTX-M-15) in 47% of isolates, bla(CTX-M-3) in 39% and
      bla(CTX-M-14) in 11%. Three bla(CTX-M-15) positive isolates were also
      bla(KPC-2) positive. High transferability was detected for bla(CTX-M-3)
      carrying plasmids (55%) with L/M and I1 replicon plasmids, followed by
      CTX-M-14 (36.4%) and CTX-M-15 (27.9%) with IncF plasmids. BlaKPC-2 was
      carried by FIIAs plasmids. Epidemiology typing revealed 8 K. pneumoniae ST
      types-ST15(8/20), ST17(4/20), ST37(2/20) and 9 E. coli ST types-ST131
      (30.9%, 21/68), ST38 (8/68), ST95(7/68) and ST316(7/68). All ST131
      isolates but one was from the highly virulent epidemic clone O25bST131.
      This is the first report in Bulgaria about ESBL/carbapenemase faecal
      carriage. We observed high ESBL/carbapenemases prevalence. A predominant
      number of isolates were members of highly epidemic and virulent
      PanEuropean clones ST15 K. pneumoniae and O25bST131 E. coli. High
      antibiotics usage during the COVID pandemic will worsen the situation.
      Routine screenings and strict infection control measures should be widely
      implemented.

      foraging in anthropogenically impacted areas, and may aid in the
      maintenance and dissemination of CRE in the environment, a spatiotemporal
      comparison of isolates from different regions and timepoints may be useful
      for elucidating epidemiological information. Thus, we characterized the
      genomic diversity of CRE from fecal samples opportunistically collected
      from gulls (Larus spp.) inhabiting Alaska (USA), Chile, Spain, Turkey, and
      Ukraine and from black kites (Milvus migrans) sampled in Pakistan and
      assessed evidence for spatiotemporal patterns of dissemination. Within and
      among sampling locations, a high diversity of carbapenemases was found,
      including Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), New Delhi
      metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM), oxacillinase (OXA), and Verona integron
      Metallo beta-lactamase (VIM). Although the majority of genomic comparisons
      among samples did not provide evidence for spatial dissemination, we did
      find strong evidence for dissemination among Alaska, Spain, and Turkey. We
      also found strong evidence for temporal dissemination among samples
      collected in Alaska and Pakistan, though the majority of CRE clones were
      transitory and were not repeatedly detected among locations where samples
      were collected longitudinally. Carbapenemase-producing hypervirulent K.
      pneumoniae was isolated from gulls in Spain and Ukraine and some isolates
      harbored antimicrobial resistance genes conferring resistance to up to 10
      different antibiotic classes, including colistin. Our results are
      consistent with local acquisition of CRE by wild birds with spatial
      dissemination influenced by intermediary transmission routes, likely
      involving humans. Furthermore, our results support the premise that
      anthropogenically-associated wild birds may be good sentinels for
      understanding the burden of clinically-relevant antimicrobial resistance
      in the local human population.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Although Sri Lanka belongs to a region with a high prevalence
      of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL), AmpC β-lactamase and
      carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, data regarding antimicrobial
      resistance (AMR) is limited. We studied the prevalence and diversity of
      β-lactamases produced by Enterobacteriaceae urinary pathogens from two
      hospitals in the Western Province of Sri Lanka. METHODS: ESBL, AmpC
      β-lactamase and carbapenemase production was detected by phenotypic
      testing followed by genotyping. RESULTS: The species responsible for
      urinary tract infections (UTI) were Escherichia coli (69%), Klebsiella
      pneumoniae (16%) and Enterobacter sp (6%). The prevalence of ESBL (50%),
      AmpC β-lactamase (19%) and carbapenemase (11%) phenotypes was high, and
      greater in hospital-acquired (HA-UTI) (75%) than in community-acquired UTI
      (CA-UTI) (42%). Identification of CA-UTI caused by carbapenemase-producing
      Enterobacteriaceae (5%) is alarming. Only one ESBL gene, bla(CTX- M-15),
      was detected. AmpC β-lactamase genes found in E. coli and K. pneumoniae
      were bla(CMY-2), bla(CMY-42) and bla(DHA-1), while Enterobacter sp.
      carried bla(ACT-1). Carbapenemase genes were bla(NDM-1), bla(NDM-4),
      bla(OXA-181) and bla(OXA-232), while bla(KPC), bla(IMP) and bla(VIM) were
      absent. Co-occurrence of multiple bla genes, with some isolates harbouring
      six different bla genes, was common. Carbapenem-resistant isolates without
      carbapenemase genes displayed mutations in the outer membrane porin genes,
      ompF of E. coli and ompK36 of K. pneumoniae. Factors associated with UTI
      with β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae were age ≥50 years, previous
      hospitalization, presence of an indwelling urinary catheter, history of
      diabetes mellitus or other chronic illness and recurrent urinary tract
      infections. CONCLUSION: This study adds to the currently scarce data on
      AMR in Sri Lanka.

TI  - Local interactions with the Glu166 base and the conformation of an active
      site loop play key roles in carbapenem hydrolysis by the KPC-2 β-lactamase

AB  - The Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-2 (KPC-2) is a common source of
      antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative bacterial infections. KPC-2 is a
      class A β-lactamase that exhibits a broad substrate profile and hydrolyzes
      most β-lactam antibiotics including carbapenems owing to rapid deacylation
      of the covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate. However, the features that allow
      KPC-2 to deacylate substrates more rapidly than non-carbapenemase enzymes
      are not clear. The active-site residues in KPC-2 are largely conserved in
      sequence and structure compared with non-carbapenemases, suggesting that
      subtle alterations may collectively facilitate hydrolysis of carbapenems.
      We utilized a nonbiased genetic approach to identify mutants deficient in
      carbapenem hydrolysis but competent for ampicillin hydrolysis. Subsequent
      pre-steady-state enzyme kinetics analyses showed that the substitutions
      slow the rate of deacylation of carbapenems. Structure determination via
      X-ray diffraction indicated that a F72Y mutant forms a hydrogen bond
      between the tyrosine hydroxyl group and Glu166, which may lower basicity
      and impair the activation of the catalytic water for deacylation, whereas
      several mutants impact the structure of the Q214-R220 active site loop. A
      T215P substitution lowers the deacylation rate and drastically alters the
      conformation of the loop, thereby disrupting interactions between the
      enzyme and the carbapenem acyl-enzyme intermediate. Thus, the environment
      of the Glu166 general base and the precise placement and conformational
      stability of the Q214-R220 loop are critical for efficient deacylation of
      carbapenems by the KPC-2 enzyme. Therefore, the design of carbapenem
      antibiotics that interact with Glu166 or alter the Q214-R220 loop
      conformation may disrupt enzyme function and overcome resistance.

AB  - An essential part of the Israeli intervention program aimed to contain the
      spread of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) has been the
      establishment of national surveillance system, where the institutional
      rates are determined by both clinical and surveillance cultures. The
      objectives of the study were to analyze the effect of changes in
      surveillance culture media on the rates and microbiological
      characteristics of CPE in a multicenter study. The rates were compared
      during 2 years in and between four centers. Two centers (Tel-Aviv and
      Beilinson) had changed their surveillance media to CHROMagar™ mSuperCARBA™
      after 1 year, and two centers (Rambam and Hillel-Yaffe) had continued to
      use CHROMagar KPC. There was an increase in the rates of surveillance CPE
      in Tel-Aviv and Beilinson following the change in media, whereas the rates
      remained the same or declined in Rambam and Hillel-Yaffe, respectively.
      The rates of clinical CPE remained unchanged in Rambam and Hillel-Yaffe,
      declined in Tel-Aviv, and increased in Beilinson but to a lesser extent
      compared with the increase in surveillance CPE. The relative composition
      of the CPE mechanisms and species changed in Tel-Aviv, with an increase in
      non-Klebsiella pneumoniae species and in carbapenemase other than KPC. Our
      study shows that changes in surveillance media may contribute to
      significant changes in the rate of surveillance CPE that may be
      irrespective of actual epidemiological changes. Therefore, determination
      of institutional burden of CPE and the assessment of intervention results
      should be based primarily on the rate of clinical CPE rather than
      surveillance culture reports.

AB  - Background: Extensive use of carbapenems to treat multidrug-resistant
      (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) facilitates the wide dissemination of
      carbapenemase-producing carbapenem-resistant GNB. Colistin was
      reintroduced into clinical settings to manage these GNB infections.
      However, there is currently an increase in the dissemination of mobile
      colistin resistance (mcr)-producing colistin-resistant GNB isolates in
      clinical settings. The epidemiology of carbapenemases and mcr in Pretoria
      was evaluated. Methods: Clinical MDR GNB were collected and screened for
      carbapenemases and mcr using polymerase chain reaction (PCR); their
      antibiotic susceptibility profiles were elucidated using the Vitek(®) 2
      automated system (Biomerieux, France) and microbroth dilution (for
      colistin). Results and Discussion: A total of 306 isolates were collected;
      a majority of these were Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 208) and were
      collected from males (n = 158). The isolates were retrieved from a variety
      of infection sites, including urine, blood cultures, and rectal swabs. The
      Vitek 2 system found that these isolates were largely resistant to
      β-lactams, where 217 (70.9%) had reduced susceptibility to at least one
      carbapenem (ertapenem, meropenem, or imipenem), and 81 isolates (26.5%)
      were resistant to colistin. PCR screening identified 201 (65.7%) isolates
      harboring carbapenemase genes consisting of bla(OXA-48) (170, 84.2%),
      bla(NDM) (31, 15.4%), bla(IMP) (5, 2%), bla(KPC) (4, 1%), and bla(VIM) (5,
      2%). Furthermore, 14 bla(OXA-48)-producing isolates were coharboring
      bla(VIM) (2), bla(NDM) (9), bla(KPC) (1), and bla(IMP) (2) genes. Only one
      isolate harbored the mobile colistin resistance (mcr)-1 gene, and this is
      the first report of an mcr-1-producing Acinetobacter baumannii isolate in
      South Africa. Conclusion: There is high endemicity of carbapenemase genes
      and a low prevalence of mcr genes in GNB, particularly in K. pneumoniae,
      in health care facilities in Pretoria and surrounding regions of South
      Africa. Significance: Health care facilities in Pretoria are becoming
      breeding grounds for MDR infections that threaten public health. Careful
      use of carbapenems and other antibiotics is necessary to prevent further
      escalation and outbreak of these MDR strains that can claim several lives.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The presence of 16S rRNA methyltranferases (16S-RMTases) in
      carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) is a major concern because
      it inactivates all clinical use of aminoglycosides, including plazomicin.
      The aim of this study is to investigate the prevalence of 16S-RMTases in
      CPE nonsusceptible to plazomicin collected in different Brazilian
      hospitals. METHODS: All isolates with plazomicin MIC ≥ 4 µg/mL (n = 67)
      were screened for the presence of 16S-RMTases by sequencing. RESULTS: 54
      (80.6%) isolates encoded 16S-RMTase genes (41 rmtB1, 7 armA, 3 rmtD2, 1
      rmtD1 and 2 rmtC). Among 41 samples rmtB1 positive, 40 co-harbored
      bla(KPC-2) and 1 bla(OXA-48) gene. Of the seven isolates harboring armA
      gene, 6 were New Delhi Metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM)-producer. rmtD was
      only found in isolates Klebsiella pneumoniae Carbapenemase
      (KPC)-producers, one in Serratia marcescens with rmtD2, not reported in
      Brazil. CONCLUSION: The co-existence of 16S-RMTase and CPE is worrisome
      because of limited treatment options and the endemic characteristic of
      (KPC) and NDM in Brazil.

AB  - The antimicrobial activities of several β-lactam agents were tested by
      broth microdilution alone and in combination with a new polymyxin analog,
      SPR741 (at a fixed concentration of 8 mg/L), against a challenge set of
      clinical isolates (202 Escherichia coli and 221 Klebsiella pneumoniae
      isolates). Using Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) or
      European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST)
      susceptibility criteria for each partner antibiotic, mecillinam-SPR741,
      temocillin-SPR741, and piperacillin-tazobactam-SPR741 combinations had
      susceptibility rates higher (85.6-100.0%) than the respective agents
      tested alone (47.5-88.7%) against extended-spectrum β-lactamase
      (ESBL)-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae. Temocillin-SPR741 (97.8%
      susceptible) had MIC(50) (minimum inhibitory concentration) and MIC(90)
      results of 0.5 and 2 mg/L, respectively, against K. pneumoniae
      carbapenemase (KPC)-producing E. coli, 8- to 16-fold lower than temocillin
      alone (MIC(50/90), 8/16 mg/L; 65.2% susceptible). The mecillinam
      MIC(50)/MIC(90) results dropped to 1/4 mg/L (from 128/>256 mg/L when
      tested alone) against metallo-β-lactamase (MBL)-producing E. coli. These
      MICs for mecillinam-SPR741 resulted in a susceptibility rate of 96.9%
      versus 9.4% for mecillinam. In general, a decrease in MICs for β-lactams
      (MIC(90), >32 mg/L) in the presence of SPR741 was not observed against
      KPC-, MBL- or OXA-48-like-producing K. pneumoniae. These study results
      indicate that some agents had a significant increase in in vitro activity
      in the presence of SPR741 and could become potential strategic options for
      treating serious infections caused by multidrug-resistant
      Enterobacteriaceae.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) are emerging
      as a worldwide threat. Long-term care facilities (LTCFs) are considered a
      reservoir for CPE and play a central role in transmission to acute care
      hospitals. We investigated the CPE positivity in patients exposed to CPE
      in LTCFs. Furthermore, we analyzed the CPE positivity rates in the
      environment exposed to CPE. METHODS: We collected rectal swab specimens
      from patients residing in LTCFs who were exposed to CPE. Environmental
      sampling was performed by infection control practitioners from sites
      classified as patient private space, common space in the patient room,
      common space other than patient rooms, and nursing station. Each sample
      was cultured on a Chrom Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) agar for
      CPE screening. The positive isolates were subjected to a polymerase chain
      reaction to identify the presence of bla(KPC), bla(VIM), bla(IMP),
      bla(OXA-48), and bla(NDM) and determine CPE genotype. RESULTS: From 65
      index cases, a total of 24 hospitals and 481 patients were enrolled; 414
      patients who had resided in the same patient room as a patient with
      confirmed CPE and 67 patients who were newly admitted to that patient
      room. A total of 117 (24.3%) patients were positive for CPE among which 93
      (22.5%, 93/414) were already admitted patients and 24 (35.8%, 24/67) were
      newly admitted patients. A total of 163 CPEs were detected and K.
      pneumoniae (n = 104, 63.8%) was the most common bacteria followed by
      Escherichia coli (n = 43, 26.4%) and Citrobacter koseri (n = 11, 6.7%).
      Environmental sampling was performed in 24 hospitals and 604 sites. A
      total of 12 sites (2.0%) were positive for CPE and sink in the nursing
      station (n = 6, 4.2%) was the most contaminated space. CONCLUSION: CPE
      colonization rates in patients exposed to CPE in LTCFs were higher than
      those found in acute care hospitals. Proper infection control measures for
      detecting and reducing CPE colonization in patients residing in LTCFs are
      required. Newly admitted patients could also be carriers; therefore,
      infection control for newly admitted patients also needs to be thorough.

      molecular characteristics of β-lactamases among Enterobacterales isolates
      causing intra-abdominal infections (IAIs) from 2015 to 2018 in the
      Asia-Pacific region. METHOD: Isolates were investigated for
      extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), AmpC β-lactamases, and
      carbapenemases using multiplex PCR assays and full-gene DNA sequencing.
      RESULT: A total of 832 Enterobacterales isolates from 8 different
      countries with β-lactamase genes were analysed. Plasmid-mediated ESBLs and
      AmpC β-lactamases were encoded in 598 (71.9 %) and 314 (37.7 %) isolates,
      respectively. In 710 (85.3 %) carbapenemase-negative isolates, positivity
      for both AmpC β-lactamases and ESBLs was identified in 51 (8.5 %)
      Escherichia coli and 24 (3.4 %) Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. The most
      prevalent countries were Taiwan and Vietnam, and the co-occurrence of
      CMY/CTX-M in E. coli and DHA-1/ESBLs in K. pneumoniae was predominant. All
      isolates showed high susceptibility to colistin, but susceptibility to
      carbapenems varied among different resistance mechanism combinations.
      Among 122 (14.7 %) isolates encoding carbapenemase, NDM (n = 67, including
      64.2 % NDM-1) was the most common, followed by the OXA-48-type (n = 49),
      KPC (n = 24) and IMP (n = 4). The most prevalent country was Thailand (n =
      44), followed by Vietnam (n = 35) and the Philippines (n = 21). Twenty-two
      isolates were found to encode multiple carbapenemases, 16 of which were
      collected from Thailand and harbored NDM-1, OXA-232 and CTX-M-15. Despite
      high susceptibility to amikacin, susceptibility to colistin was only 56 %.
      CONCLUSION: The emergence of carbapenem-non-susceptible AmpC/ESBL
      co-occurring Enterobacterales and colistin non-susceptible carbapenemases
      co-occurring K. pneumoniae highlights potential therapeutic challenges in
      the Asia-Pacific region.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to analyze the activity of the
      imipenem-relebactam combination (IMI/REL) against a collection of
      multidrug-resist Enterobacterales, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and
      Acinetobacter baumannii clinical isolates. METHODS: The study was
      conducted in two tertiary hospitals in Spain and included 192 clinical
      isolates of these 3 genera (139 resistant and 53 susceptible to IMI). The
      MICs for IMI with and without REL (at a fixed concentration of 4 mg/L)
      were determined by a standard broth microdilution method according to
      international recommendations. RESULTS: All IMI-susceptible E. coli
      strains were also susceptible to IMI/REL. Enterobacterales resistant to
      IMI due to the production of carbapenemases, the MIC50 and MIC90 decreased
      from 64/256 with IMI to 8/64 mg/L with IMI/REL. This high activity was
      principally detected among isolates with KPC enzymes. Enterobacterales
      with class B carbapenemases, P. aeruginosa carrying VIM carbapenemase and
      A. baumannii strains showed no changes on IMI MIC50 or MIC90 after adding
      REL. Among P. aeruginosa strains without carbapenemase the MIC for IMI/REL
      was reduced between 1 to 5 dilutions. CONCLUSIONS: IMI/REL showed high
      activity against the strains that carry Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenemase (KPC) and against carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa
      unrelated to the VIM enzyme, mainly AmpC beta lactamase associated with
      impermeability. Against strains carrying oxacillinase 48 (OXA-48)
      associated with extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), IMI/REL presented
      activity only slightly better than IMI and had no beneficial effect
      superior to IMI against A. baumannii.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In low- and middle-income countries, the use of colistin in
      therapeutic regimens is common, to treat infections produced for
      Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) due to limited access to
      the recently discovered-approved antibiotics. Furthermore, the technical
      limitations to perform colistin susceptibility tests make it difficult to
      assess the suitability of this treatment for each patient, as well as to
      monitor the rates of resistance. In the present study, we describe the use
      of agar dilution using a unique colistin concentration of 3 μg/ml to
      discriminate isolates with colistin resistance in CPE obtained from
      clinical samples. METHODS: Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI)
      colistin broth microdilution method and dilution agar with a colistin
      concentration of 3 μg/ml were performed in 168 isolates of CPE obtained
      from clinical samples in Guayaquil, Ecuador. Broth microdilution was
      considered our gold standard using CLSI breakpoints as reference (≤2 μg/ml
      intermediate and ≥4 μg/ml resistant). Categorical agreement was defined as
      obtaining a reading within the same category with both methodologies.
      RESULTS: Isolates obtained from respiratory samples were the most
      prevalent (26.19%; n = 44). Klebsiella pneumoniae was the predominant
      specie (94.04%; n = 158). KPC-like carbapenemase was present in all the
      isolates, and interestingly, colistin resistance was not mediated by MCR-1
      production. Categorical agreement between both methods resulted in 97.02%.
      CONCLUSION: We propose the use of dilution agar with a colistin
      concentration of 3 μg/ml, as a valid method for screening colistin
      resistance in low- and middle-income countries to monitor resistance and
      to perform epidemiological studies.

AB  - The increasing spread of drug-resistant bacterial strains presents great
      challenges to clinical antibacterial treatment and public health,
      particularly with regard to β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. A
      rapid and accurate detection method that can expedite precise clinical
      diagnostics and rational administration of antibiotics is urgently needed.
      Targeted proteomics, a technique involving selected reaction monitoring or
      multiple reaction monitoring, has been developed for detecting specific
      peptides. In the present study, a rapid single-colony-processing procedure
      combined with an improved parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) workflow
      based on HRAM Orbitrap MS was developed to detect carbapenemases
      (Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase, KPC; imipenemase, IMP; Verona
      integron-encoded metallo-β-lactamase, VIM; New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase,
      NDM; and oxacillinase, OXA), extended spectrum β-lactamases (TEM and
      CTX-M), and AmpC (CMY-2) produced by Enterobacteriaceae. Specific peptides
      were selected and validated, and their coefficients of variation and
      stability were evaluated. In total, 188 Enterobacteriaceae strains were
      screened using the workflow. Fourteen out of total 19 peptides have 100%
      specificity; three peptides have specificity >95% and two peptides have
      specificity ranged from 74∼85%. On the sensitivity, only nine peptides
      have 95∼100% sensitivity. The other 10 peptides have sensitivity ranged
      from 27∼94%. Thus, a screening method based on peptide groups was
      developed for the first time. Taken together, this study described a rapid
      extraction and detection workflow for widespread β-lactamases, including
      KPC, IMP, VIM, NDM, OXA, CMY, CTX-M, and TEM, using single colonies of
      Enterobacteriaceae strains. PRM-targeted proteomics was proven to be a
      promising approach for the detection of drug-resistant enzymes.

AB  - Carbapenem resistance among Enterobacteriaceae is a major concern that is
      increasingly reported worldwide. The objective of this study is to
      determine the incidence of carbapenem resistance as well as to investigate
      for carbapenemase-encoding genes among Enterobacteriaceae clinical
      isolates from cancer patients at different cancer institutes in Egypt.
      This determination was a cross-sectional study with a total of 135
      clinical isolates collected over a period of 1 year. All isolates were
      sub-cultured on ChromID agar and subjected to phenotypic and molecular
      detection of carbapenemases. Most of the Enterobacteriaceae isolates were
      MDR with high resistance rates against tested antimicrobials. Overall, the
      results of PCR assays revealed that 89.62% (121/135) of isolates harbored
      one or more of the carbapenemase-encoding genes, while phenotypic assays
      revealed the production of carbapenemases in 68.88% (93/135) of isolates.
      BlastN analysis against the non-redundant genome sequences available in
      the GenBank database revealed that the bla(NDM-1) gene was the most
      prevalent genotype of carbapenemases in 93/135 (68.88%), followed by
      bla(OXA-48) 44/135 (32.59%), bla(OXA-23) 42/135 (31.11%), and bla(KPC-2)
      2/135 (1.48%). Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates harbored the highest number
      of carbapenemase-encoding genes 34/121 (28.09%). The high prevalence of
      carbapenemases and/or their encoding genes among MDR Enterobacteriaceae
      bacteria in Egypt is alarming, thus, the management of serious infections
      caused by Enterobacteriaceae, particularly in cancer patients will be
      challenging to clinicians. Carbapenemase bla(NDM) genotype is emerging in
      cancer healthcare settings in Egypt, which could be the cause of the
      current increase in carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae.

AB  - Antimicrobial-resistant (AMR) infections pose a serious risk to human and
      animal health. A major factor contributing to this global crisis is the
      sharing of resistance genes between different bacteria via plasmids. The
      WHO lists Enterobacteriaceae, such as Escherichia coli and Klebsiella
      pneumoniae, producing extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) and
      carbapenemases as "critical" priorities for new drug development. These
      resistance genes are most often shared via plasmid transfer. However,
      finding methods to prevent resistance gene sharing has been hampered by
      the lack of screening systems for medium-/high-throughput approaches.
      Here, we have used an ESBL-producing plasmid, pCT, and a
      carbapenemase-producing plasmid, pKpQIL, in two different Gram-negative
      bacteria, E. coli and K. pneumoniae Using these critical
      resistance-pathogen combinations, we developed an assay using fluorescent
      proteins, flow cytometry, and confocal microscopy to assess plasmid
      transmission inhibition within bacterial populations in a
      medium-throughput manner. Three compounds with some reports of antiplasmid
      properties were tested; chlorpromazine reduced transmission of both
      plasmids and linoleic acid reduced transmission of pCT. We screened the
      Prestwick library of over 1,200 FDA-approved drugs/compounds. From this,
      we found two nucleoside analogue drugs used to treat HIV, abacavir and
      azidothymidine (AZT), which reduced plasmid transmission (AZT, e.g., at
      0.25 μg/ml reduced pCT transmission in E. coli by 83.3% and pKpQIL
      transmission in K. pneumoniae by 80.8% compared to untreated controls).
      Plasmid transmission was reduced by concentrations of the drugs which are
      below peak serum concentrations and are achievable in the gastrointestinal
      tract. These drugs could be used to decolonize humans, animals, or the
      environment from AMR plasmids.IMPORTANCE More and more bacterial
      infections are becoming resistant to antibiotics. This has made treatment
      of many infections very difficult. One of the reasons this is such a large
      problem is that bacteria are able to share their genetic material with
      other bacteria, and these shared genes often include resistance to a
      variety of antibiotics, including some of our drugs of last resort. We are
      addressing this problem by using a fluorescence-based system to search for
      drugs that will stop bacteria from sharing resistance genes. We uncovered
      a new role for two drugs used to treat HIV and show that they are able to
      prevent the sharing of two different types of resistance genes in two
      unique bacterial strains. This work lays the foundation for future work to
      reduce the prevalence of resistant infections.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To determine the spread of ESBLs and carbapenemases in
      Enterobacterales and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in Europe. METHODS: 45 335
      Gram-negative bacilli were collected in 18 European countries as part of
      the International Network for Optimal Resistance Monitoring (INFORM)
      global surveillance programme from 2013 to 2017. Antimicrobial
      susceptibility was determined using broth microdilution, and 9546 isolates
      were screened for β-lactamase genes by PCR and sequencing. RESULTS: ESBLs
      were identified in 35.5% of Klebsiella pneumoniae and 18.5% of Escherichia
      coli. ESBL carriage was lowest among isolates in Northern/Western Europe
      and highest in Eastern Europe. CTX-M-15 was the dominant ESBL in all
      countries except Greece, where SHV-type ESBLs were more common.
      Carbapenemases (KPC, OXA-48-like, GES, NDM and VIM) were found in 3.4% of
      Enterobacterales and were most common among K. pneumoniae (10.5% of those
      collected). Carbapenemase carriage was lowest in Northern/Western and
      highest in Southern Europe. KPC-positive Enterobacterales were most
      abundant but the percentages of OXA-48-like-, NDM- and VIM-positive
      isolates increased over time and were correlated with an increase in
      meropenem non-susceptibility. Carbapenemases (VIM, IMP, NDM and GES) were
      also identified in 5.1% of P. aeruginosa and were commonly found in
      Eastern Europe. Carbapenemase carriage and meropenem non-susceptibility
      among P. aeruginosa fluctuated over the 5 years studied and were not well
      correlated. CONCLUSIONS: ESBL and carbapenemase carriage varied by species
      and European subregion. Meropenem non-susceptibility in European isolates
      of Enterobacterales can be attributed to carbapenemase carriage and is
      increasingly caused by MBLs and OXA-48-like carbapenemases. Carbapenemases
      or other β-lactamases are not a common cause of meropenem
      non-susceptibility in P. aeruginosa in Europe.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) represent a
      serious threat for human health being frequently resistant to most of
      available antibiotics classes. Recently, ceftazidime/avibactam (CAZ/AVI)
      has been approved for treatment of infections by Gram-negative bacteria,
      including class A CPE (including KPC-producing K. pneumoniae). Following
      CAZ/AVI commercialization, resistance to this combination has been
      reported. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence of CAZ/AVI
      resistance among carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae(CR-Kp) isolates
      recovered from bloodstream infections (BSI) and hospital-acquired
      pneumonia (HAP), representative of the contemporary southern Italy
      epidemiology, during the first pandemic wave of SARS-CoV-2. METHODS: From
      Jan...20-Jun...20, 4 Laboratories, collected all consecutive,
      non-replicated CR-Kp from BSIs and HAPs. All isolates were subjected to i)
      MALDI-ToF identification; ii) antimicrobial susceptibility testing by
      microdilution method. CAZ/AVI resistant (CAZ/AVI-R) isolates were screened
      for presence of most common carbapenemase genes and subjected to whole
      genome sequencing for characterization. RESULTS: A total of 89 isolates
      were collected. The majority of strains retained susceptibility to
      colistin, gentamicin and amikacin. Three strains (3/89, 3,4%) were
      CAZ/AVI-R (MIC range 16/4-64/4 mg/L). Among CAZ/AVI-R, one was KPC-type
      producer (an ST101) while the remaining where NDM-type and VIM-type
      producers and belonged to ST147, and ST45, respectively. CONCLUSION:
      During the pandemic period, in southern Italy, CAZ/AVI resistance remained
      infrequent but high-risk Klebsiella pneumoniae epidemic clones, producing
      the KPC-31 variant and class B carbapenamases were reported from some of
      the included centers.

TI  - Interaction of LysM BON family protein domain with carbapenems: A putative
      mechanism of carbapenem resistance

AB  - Carbapenem resistance in Gram-negative pathogens has become a global
      concern for health workers worldwide. In one of our earlier studies, a
      Klebsiella pneumoniae-carbapenemase-2 producing strain was induced with
      meropenem to explore differentially expressed proteins under induced and
      uninduced conditions. There is, LysM domain BON family protein, was found
      over 12-fold expressed under the induced state. A hypothesis was proposed
      that LysM domain protein might have an affinity towards carbapenem
      antibiotics making them unavailable to bind with their target. Hence, we
      initiated a study to understand the binding mode of carbapenem with LysM
      domain protein. MICs of imipenem and meropenem against LysM clone were
      increased by several folds as compared to NP-6 clinical strain as well as
      DH5 α (PET-28a KPC-2) clone. This study further revealed a strong binding
      of both antibiotics to LysM domain protein. Molecular simulation studies
      of LysM domain protein with meropenem and imipenem for 80 ns has also
      showed stable structure. We concluded that overexpressed LysM domain under
      induced condition interacted with carbapenems, leading to enhanced
      resistance as proved by high MIC values. Hence, the study proved the
      proposed hypothesis that the LysM domain plays a significant role in the
      putative mechanism of antibiotics resistance.

TI  - Flanker: a tool for comparative genomics of gene flanking regions

CY  - England
AB  - Analysing the flanking sequences surrounding genes of interest is often
      highly relevant to understanding the role of mobile genetic elements
      (MGEs) in horizontal gene transfer, particular for
      antimicrobial-resistance genes. Here, we present Flanker, a Python package
      that performs alignment-free clustering of gene flanking sequences in a
      consistent format, allowing investigation of MGEs without prior knowledge
      of their structure. These clusters, known as 'flank patterns' (FPs), are
      based on Mash distances, allowing for easy comparison of similarity across
      sequences. Additionally, Flanker can be flexibly parameterized to
      fine-tune outputs by characterizing upstream and downstream regions
      separately, and investigating variable lengths of flanking sequence. We
      apply Flanker to two recent datasets describing plasmid-associated
      carriage of important carbapenemase genes (bla(OXA-48) and bla(KPC-2/3))
      and show that it successfully identifies distinct clusters of FPs,
      including both known and previously uncharacterized structural variants.
      For example, Flanker identified four Tn4401 profiles that could not be
      sufficiently characterized using TETyper or MobileElementFinder,
      demonstrating the utility of Flanker for flanking-gene characterization.
      Similarly, using a large (n=226) European isolate dataset, we confirm
      findings from a previous smaller study demonstrating association between
      Tn1999.2 and bla(OXA-48) upregulation and demonstrate 17 FPs (compared to
      the 5 previously identified). More generally, the demonstration in this
      study that FPs are associated with geographical regions and
      antibiotic-susceptibility phenotypes suggests that they may be useful as
      epidemiological markers. Flanker is freely available under an MIT license

TI  - Susceptibility of Clinical Enterobacterales Isolates With Common and Rare
      Carbapenemases to Mecillinam
T2  - Front Microbiol
VL  - 11

CY  - Switzerland
AB  - Purpose: To investigate the susceptibility of carbapenemase-producing
      Enterobacterales (CPE) to mecillinam based on the recently updated
      European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST)
      breakpoints for uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infection (uUTI). Methods: The
      challenge collection consisted of 105 molecularly characterized
      Enterobacterales [Klebsiella spp. (N = 49), Escherichia coli (N = 30),
      Enterobacter cloacae (n = 13), Citrobacter freundii (N = 9), Proteus
      mirabilis (N = 3), and Raoultella ornithinolytica (N = 1)]. Isolates
      produced OXA-48 (N = 18), OXA-48-like (N = 18), VIM (N = 22), NDM (N =
      22), KPC (N = 12), IMI (N = 9), IMP (N = 6), GES (N = 1), OXA-58 (N = 2)
      or combinations thereof (N = 5). MICs of carbapenems were determined by
      agar gradient diffusion (AGD). MICs of mecillinam were assessed by agar
      dilution (reference method) and compared to disk diffusion (DD) and AGD.
      Results: Overall 23/105 CPE (21.9%) were susceptible to mecillinam.
      Susceptibility was observed in E. coli (N = 12), E. cloacae (N = 7), and
      Klebsiella pneumoniae (N = 4) producing IMI, OXA-48, OXA-48-like, and
      NDM-1 carbapenemases. MIC(50) for mecillinam in all isolates was 128 mg/L
      while MIC(50) for meropenem was 8 mg/L. Lower MICs for mecillinam were
      found in IMI (MIC(50) 8 mg/L) and OXA-48-like (MIC(50) 16 mg/L) producers.
      The comparison of the different susceptibility methods showed very major
      errors of 12.2% with AGD and 8.5% with disk diffusion when compared to the
      reference method. Conclusion: Mecillinam susceptibility was restricted to
      isolates producing IMI-, OXA-48-like, and NDM-1 carbapenemases and was
      documented despite high carbapenem MICs in some isolates. Mecillinam could
      be a promising oral antimicrobial in uUTI caused by E. coli and E. cloacae
      isolates carrying IMI- and OXA-48-like carbapenemases; however,
      susceptibility testing by AGD and disk diffusion remains problematic.

AB  - Nacubactam is a novel non-β-lactam diazabicyclooctane β-lactamase
      inhibitor under development for the treatment of serious Gram-negative
      infections. This study assessed the efficacy of human-simulated epithelial
      lining fluid (ELF) exposure of nacubactam in combination with meropenem
      against AmpC-overproducing (n=4) and Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase
      (KPC)-expressing (n=3) Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates in the neutropenic
      murine lung infection model. Meropenem, nacubactam and
      meropenem-nacubactam (1:1 concentration ratio) minimum inhibitory
      concentrations (MICs) were determined in triplicate using broth
      microdilution. Regimens that provided ELF profiles mimicking those
      observed in humans given nacubactam 2 g q8h (1.5-h infusion) alone and in
      combination with a subtherapeutic ELF exposure of meropenem were
      administered 2 h after inoculation. Efficacy was assessed as the change in
      log(10) colony-forming units (CFU)/lung at 24 h compared with 24-h
      meropenem monotherapy. Meropenem, nacubactam and meropenem-nacubactam MICs
      were 8->64, 128->256 and 2-16 mg/L, respectively. Meropenem and nacubactam
      monotherapy groups demonstrated bacterial growth over 24 h for each
      isolate. Against AmpC-overproducing and KPC-expressing P. aeruginosa
      isolates, meropenem-nacubactam resulted in -2.73±0.93 and -4.35±1.90
      log(10)CFU/lung reduction, respectively, relative to meropenem
      monotherapy. Meropenem-nacubactam showed promising in-vivo activity
      against meropenem-resistant P. aeruginosa, indicative of a potential role
      for the treatment of infections caused by these challenging pathogens.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This study examined ceftazidime-avibactam activity against
      carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) clinical isolates and
      resistance mechanisms among non-metallo β-lactamase (MBL) producers
      displaying ceftazidime-avibactam MIC values at 4 mg/L. METHODS: CRE
      isolates (286 of 8161 Enterobacterales) collected in Asia-Pacific, Europe
      and Latin America during 2016 were screened for carbapenemase genes.
      Selected isolates were susceptibility tested for ceftazidime-avibactam in
      the presence or absence of phenylalanine-arginyl β-naphthylamide (PAβN)
      and polymyxin B nonapeptide (PMBN). Genome sequences were investigated for
      the integrity of outer membrane protein (OMP) genes and multilocus
      sequence typing. qRT-PCR assays were conducted to determine expression of
      acrA, ampC, and OMP genes. RESULTS: Ceftazidime-avibactam inhibited 99.2%
      of the Enterobacterales, 22 (78.7%) of the 286 CRE and 226 (100%) non-MBL
      producers. Among carbapenemase producers (85.3%; 244 of 286), the most
      common gene was bla(KPC) (76 bla(KPC-3) and 46 bla(KPC-2)), followed by
      bla(OXA-48)-like (60 isolates) and bla(NDM) (37). Ceftazidime-avibactam
      MIC values at 4 mg/L were noted among 14 Klebsiella pneumoniae (13
      carrying bla(KPC) and 1 bla(CTX-M-15)) mostly from Italy and Brazil and 1
      Klebsiella aerogenes overexpressing ampC. PAβN did not significantly
      decrease ceftazidime-avibactam results, but adding PMBN did significantly
      decrease the MIC results for the combination. All K. pneumoniae isolates
      had a premature stop codon at OmpK35 and most isolates had L3 alterations
      of OmpK36, low expression of this gene, or OmpC disruption (K. aerogenes).
      Nine K. pneumoniae isolates belonged to clonal complex 258 and displayed
      intrahospital clonality. CONCLUSION: Ceftazidime-avibactam is an important
      addition to the armamentarium against multidrug-resistant organisms, and
      elevated MIC results for this combination seem to be associated with L3
      OmpK36 alterations and β-lactamases able to hydrolyze ceftazidime.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) are highly
      concerning MDR pathogens. Horizontal transfer of broad-host-range IncN
      plasmids may contribute to the dissemination of the Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenemase (KPC), spreading carbapenem resistance among unrelated
      bacteria. However, the population structure and genetic diversity of IncN
      plasmids has not been fully elucidated. OBJECTIVES: We reconstructed
      blaKPC-harbouring IncN plasmid genomes to characterize shared gene
      content, structural variability, and putative horizontal transfer within
      and across patients and diverse bacterial clones. METHODS: We performed
      short- and long-read sequencing and hybrid assembly on 45 CRE isolates
      with blaKPC-harbouring IncN plasmids. Eight serial isolates from two
      patients were included to assess intra-patient plasmid dynamics.
      Comparative genomic analysis was performed to assess structural and
      sequence similarity across plasmids. Within IncN sublineages defined by
      plasmid MLST and kmer-based clustering, phylogenetic analysis was used to
      identify closely related plasmids. RESULTS: Comparative analysis of IncN
      plasmid genomes revealed substantial heterogeneity including large
      rearrangements in serial patient plasmids and differences in structure and
      content across plasmid clusters. Within plasmid sublineages, core genome
      content and resistance gene regions were largely conserved. Closely
      related plasmids (≤1 SNP) were found in highly diverse isolates, including
      ten pST6 plasmids found in eight bacterial clones from three different
      species. CONCLUSIONS: Genomic analysis of blaKPC-harbouring IncN plasmids
      revealed the presence of several distinct sublineages as well as
      substantial host diversity within plasmid clusters suggestive of frequent
      mobilization. This study reveals complex plasmid dynamics within a single
      plasmid family, highlighting the challenge of tracking plasmid-mediated
      transmission of blaKPC in clinical settings.

AB  - The β-lactam drugs resistance poses a serious threat to human health
      throughout the world. Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase 2 (KPC-2) is a
      carbapenemase that produced in bacteria can hydrolyze carbapenems, which
      typically considered as the antibiotics of last resort. Therefore, there
      is an urgent need to quickly and accurately detect whether bacteria
      express KPC-2. In this paper, a PDMS/glass microfluidic biochip integrated
      with aptamer-modified Ag(10)NPs nano-biosensors was developed for rapid,
      simple and specific pathogenic bacteria detection, more importantly, the
      biochip was combined with bright field imaging, then the captured bacteria
      could be observed and counted directly without using extra chemical
      labeling. KPC-2-expressing Escherichia coli (KPC-2 E.coli) was used as the
      target bacterium with a detected limit of 10(2) CFU and capture efficiency
      exceeded 90%. This method is remarkably specific towards KPC-2 E.coli over
      other non-resistant bacteria, and pathogen assay only takes ∼1 h to
      complete in a ready-to-use microfluidic biochip. Furthermore, the
      effective capture and fast counting of microfluidic biochip system
      demonstrates its potential for the rapid detection of antibiotic-resistant
      bacteria.

CY  - England
AB  - Carbapenemases inactivate most β-lactam antibiotics, including
      carbapenems, and have frequently been reported among Enterobacteriaceae,
      Acinetobacter spp. and Pseudomonas spp. Traditionally, the horizontal gene
      transfer of carbapenemase-encoding genes (CEGs) has been linked to
      plasmids. However, given that integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs)
      are possibly the most abundant conjugative elements among prokaryotes, we
      conducted an in silico analysis to ascertain the likely role of ICEs in
      the spread of CEGs among all bacterial genomes (n=182 663). We detected 17
      520 CEGs, of which 66 were located within putative ICEs among several
      bacterial species (including clinically relevant bacteria, such as
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli). Most
      CEGs detected within ICEs belong to the IMP, NDM and SPM
      metallo-beta-lactamase families, and the serine beta-lactamase KPC and GES
      families. Different mechanisms were likely responsible for acquisition of
      these genes. The majority of CEG-bearing ICEs belong to the MPF(G), MPF(T)
      and MPF(F) classes and often encode resistance to other antibiotics (e.g.
      aminoglycosides and fluoroquinolones). This study provides a snapshot of
      the different CEGs associated with ICEs among available bacterial genomes
      and sheds light on the underappreciated contribution of ICEs to the spread
      of carbapenem resistance globally.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) caused by
      carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria has been proven to be an
      escalating public health challenge in Egypt owing to its high mortality
      rate and raised health care costs. PURPOSE: Detection of
      carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacilli among VAP patients, genotypic
      identification of carbapenemase genes in the isolated strains with
      evaluation of their impact on patient outcome and detection of
      carbapenemase-producing enterobacterales by MASTDISCS combi Carba plus
      disc system. METHODS: Broncho-alveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and
      endotracheal aspirate were collected aseptically from clinically suspected
      VAP patients. Pathogen identification and antibiotic sensitivity testing
      were done. Carbapenemase-encoding genes (bla (KPC), bla (NDM), and bla
      (OXA-48)) were tested by PCR in all carbapenem-resistant gram-negative
      isolates. Performance of MASTDISCS combi Carba plus in isolated
      Enterobacterales was assessed in relation to the PCR results. RESULTS:
      Eighty-three carbapenem-resistant gram-negative isolates were detected.
      The most frequent pathogens were Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter
      baumannii and Pseudomonas aeruginosa representing 34.9%, 20.5% and 18.1%,
      respectively. bla (KPC) was the predominant gene. Patients with persistent
      mechanical ventilation less than 15 days and Pseudomonas aeruginosa
      infection were significantly associated with a higher death rate.
      MAST-Carba plus had the highest sensitivity, specificity, positive and
      negative predictive values for detecting OXA-48 carbapenemases
      representing 81.8%, 92.5%, 75% and 94.9%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Worse
      outcome in VAP patients was associated with carbapenem-resistant
      gram-negative bacilli. MASTDISCS combi Carba plus is an efficient simple
      method for identification of different carbapenemases among
      enterobacterales.

AB  - The utility of weekly rectal swab surveillance cultures (RSSCs) as a
      resource to identify gut colonization with extended-spectrum
      beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli or Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenemase (KPC)-producing organisms and guide empirical antibiotic
      therapy in hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) recipients
      continues to be a subject of interest. There is an urgent need to assess
      and justify modifications to empirical antibiotics based on regional
      epidemiology and patient groups. This study aimed to study the utility of
      weekly rectal swab surveillance cultures (RSSCs) to guide empirical
      antibiotic therapy and to examine the impact of gut colonization on
      transplantation outcomes. This retrospective analysis of 317 successive
      first HSCTs performed mainly for hemoglobinopathies was conducted in 3
      pediatric bone marrow transplantation centers in the Indian subcontinent
      between April 2016 and April 2021. Transplantation, infection control, and
      febrile neutropenia management protocols were identical in the 3 centers.
      First-line antibiotics were chosen based on RCCS reports, with meropenem
      used for ESBL and high-dose meropenem with colistin used for
      carbapenemase-resistant colonization for first half of the study, with no
      adjustment made in the second half. Clinical response to antibiotics,
      long-term outcomes, antibiotic-resistant bacteremia, and acute
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) were analyzed. The log-rank test,
      chi-square, and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to compare data using R
      Statistical software. Of the 871 weekly RSSCs done, 162 were positive for
      ESBL- or KPC-resistant organism. RCCSs were ESBL-positive in 106 patients
      (33%) and KPC-positive in 10 patients (3%). Among the 97 ESBL-positive
      patients for whom a antimicrobial susceptibility testing report was
      available, only 22 (25%) demonstrated clinical resistance to
      piperacillin-tazobactam (Pip-Taz). Among the 10 KPC-positive patients,
      only 4 (40%) demonstrated clinical resistance to Pip-Taz and 3 (30%) had
      clinical resistance to meropenem. Two-thirds of patients with
      ESBL-positive RSSC in whom first-line empirical antibiotics were used
      responded clinically. Even among the 15 patients who were resistant to
      first-line empirical antibiotics (Pip-Taz) on RSSC reports, 67% responded
      clinically to Pip-Taz. Twenty-seven of these patients (56%) never needed
      carbapenem therapy. Empirical Pip-Taz therapy in ESBL-positive patients
      did not prolong meropenem use within 100 days of transplantation (P =
      .18). All patients with a KPC-positive RSSC who received first-line
      empirical antibiotics responded clinically, including 4 who were resistant
      to Pip-Taz and 3 who were meropenem-resistant on RCCS. Comparing patients
      who were ESBL-positive, KPC-positive, and not positive for either showed
      no statistically significant differences in overall survival (OS) (P =
      .95), disease-free survival (DFS) (P = .45), transplantation-related
      mortality (TRM) (P = .97), graft rejection (P = .68), or rate of acute
      GVHD grade II-IV (P = .78). No statistically significant differences were
      seen between the ESBL-positive patients who received and those who did not
      receive higher-level empirical antibiotics in OS (P = .32), DFS (P = .64),
      TRM (P = .65), graft rejection (P = .46), acute GVHD grade II-IV (P =
      .26), or antibiotic-resistant bacteremia (P = .3). In the context of HSCT
      for nonmalignant hematologic disorders, choosing empiric antibiotic
      therapy based on RSSCs is not justified, even in regions with a high
      prevalence of antimicrobial resistance. Antimicrobial susceptibility
      testing reports in surveillance cultures did not correlate with in vivo
      clinical response. Colonization reported on weekly RSSCs showed no
      correlation with clinical outcomes. © 2021 American Society for

AB  - The emergence of novel resistant markers hampers the efficacy of
      beta-lactam antibiotics to treat infections caused by micro-organisms
      carrying such resistances. This study investigated the antimicrobial
      susceptibility pattern, the carpapenem-associated determinants and the
      molecular epidemiology of Klebsiella pneumoniae showing a New Delhi (NDM)
      metallo-β-lactamase phenotype, isolated from a patient admitted to
      intensive care unit of the main hospital for acute care of Molise region,
      central Italy. Antimicrobial susceptibility was assessed for nineteen
      antibiotics by disc diffusion and agar dilution methods.
      Carbapenem-associated resistance determinants were detected through
      gene-specific amplifications, targeting bla(NDM-1) , bla(SHV) and bla(TEM)
      , bla(CTX-M) , bla(KPC) , bla(VIM) , bla(IMP) , bla(GES) and
      bla(OXA-48-lixe) . Molecular characterization was carried out through
      multilocus sequence typing. The strain showed a multidrug resistant
      profile, and PCR and sequencing confirmed the presence of bla(NDM-1) gene.
      Among the multiple resistance-associated determinants tested, the isolate,
      which was assigned to the sequence type ST11, only harboured bla(SHV) and
      bla(TEM) genes. This is the first report of NDM-1 variant in the regional
      healthcare setting for acute patients, raising significant concerns about
      the increase in the antimicrobials resistance spread through a different
      mechanism from the endemic KPC carbapenemase, and underlining the
      circulation of a virulent clone never identified before in this area.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To study the molecular epidemiology of clinical
      metallo-β-lactamase (MBL)-producing Enterobacteriaceae isolates in China
      and to evaluate the antimicrobial susceptibility of MBL-Enterobacteriaceae
      isolates to aztreonam-avibactam. METHODS: Bacterial speciation was
      determined using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization
      time-of-flight mass spectrometry. PCR was used to screen for common
      carbapenemase genes. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing of common
      clinical antibiotics and aztreonam-avibactam was performed using the
      standard broth microdilution method. RESULTS: A total of 161
      MBL-Enterobacteriaceae isolates were included, with Klebsiella pneumoniae
      (n = 73, 45.4%) and Escherichia coli (n = 53, 32.9%) being the most common
      species. Among the 161 isolates, bla(NDM) (n = 151), bla(IMP) (n = 13),
      and bla(VIM) (n = 2) were detected, including five strains (3.1%)
      co-harboring two MBLs. MBL-Enterobacteriaceae isolates frequently
      contained two (n = 55, 34.2%) or more (n = 89, 55.3%) additional serine
      β-lactamase genes (bla(KPC), bla(CTX-M), bla(TEM), or bla(SHV)).
      Antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed that 81.4% of isolates (n =
      131) were resistant to aztreonam. The rates of resistance to cefazolin,
      ceftazidime, ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, ampicillin-sulbactam,
      amoxicillin-clavulanic acid, and piperacillin-tazobactam were all over
      90%. The addition of avibactam (4 μg/ml) significantly reduced the minimum
      inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of the aztreonam-resistant isolates by
      more than 8-fold (range ≤0.125 to 4 μg/ml), with a MIC(50)/MIC(90) of
      ≤0.125/1 μg/ml among the 131 isolates. Overall, 96.9% (n = 156) of the
      total isolates were inhibited at an aztreonam-avibactam concentration of
      ≤1 μg/ml. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis found
      that in patients with MBL-Enterobacteriaceae infections, the presence of
      pre-existing lung disease (adjusted odds ratio 8.267, 95% confidence
      interval 1.925-28.297; p = 0.004) was associated with a hazard effect on
      worse disease outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The combined use of
      aztreonam-avibactam is highly potent against MBL-Enterobacteriaceae and
      may serve as a new candidate for the treatment of infections caused by
      MBL-Enterobacteriaceae in China.

TI  - A pentaplex real-time PCR assay for rapid identification of major
      beta-lactamase genes KPC, NDM, CTX, CMY, and OXA-48 directly from bacteria
      in blood

AB  - Introduction. Antibiotic resistance, particularly in cases of sepsis, has
      emerged as a growing global public health concern and economic burden.
      Current methods of blood culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing
      of agents involved in sepsis can take as long as 3-5 days. It is vital to
      rapidly identify which antimicrobials can be used to effectively treat
      sepsis cases on an individual basis. Here, we present a pentaplex,
      real-time PCR-based assay that can quickly identify the most common
      beta-lactamase genes (Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC); New Delhi
      metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM); cefotaximase-Munich (CTX-M); cephamycin AmpC
      beta-lactamases (CMY); and Oxacillinase-48 (OXA-48)) from pathogens
      derived directly from the blood of patients presenting with bacterial
      septicemia.Aim. To develop an assay which can rapidly identify the most
      common beta-lactamase genes in Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae
      bacteria (CREs) from the United States.Hypothesis/Gap Statement.
      Septicemia caused by carbapenem-resistant bacteria has a death rate of
      40-60 %. Rapid diagnosis of antibiotic susceptibility directly from
      bacteria in blood by identification of beta-lactamase genes will greatly
      improve survival rates. In this work, we develop an assay capable of
      concurrently identifying the five most common beta-lactamase and
      carbapenemase genes.Methodology. Primers and probes were created which can
      identify all subtypes of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC); New
      Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM); cefotaximase-Munich (CTX); cephamycin
      AmpC beta-lactamase (CMY); and oxacillinase-48 (OXA-48). The assay was
      validated using 13 isolates containing various PCR targets from the Centre
      for Disease Control Antimicrobial Resistance Isolate Bank Enterobacterales
      Carbapenemase Diversity Panel. Blood obtained from volunteers was spiked
      with CREs and bacteria were separated, lysed, and subjected to analysis
      via the pentaplex assay.Results. This pentaplex assay successfully
      identified beta-lactamase genes derived from bacteria separated from blood
      at concentrations of 4-8 c.f.u. ml(-1).Conclusion. This assay will improve
      patient outcomes by supplying physicians with critical drug resistance
      information within 2 h of septicemia onset, allowing them to prescribe
      effective antimicrobials corresponding to the resistance gene(s) present
      in the pathogen. In addition, information supplied by this assay will
      lessen the inappropriate use of broad-spectrum antimicrobials and prevent
      the evolution of further antibiotic resistance.

AB  - Invasive infections caused by carbapenemase-producing bacteria are
      associated with excess mortality. We applied a rapid diagnostic test (RDT)
      on clinical samples with an elevated likelihood of carbapenemase-producing
      bacteria and documented its impact on antibiotic treatment decisions.
      Among 38 patients, twelve tested positive for infections caused by
      carbapenemase-producing bacteria (31.6%), mainly in blood cultures. KPC (n
      = 10) was more frequent than OXA-48 (n = 2). RDT-based carbapenemase
      detection led to a treatment modification to
      ceftazidime/avibactam-containing regimens in all patients before detailed
      antibiotic testing results became available. Eleven patients (92%)
      survived the acute infection, whereas one patient with a
      ceftazidime/avibactam- and colistin-resistant OXA-48-positive isolate
      died.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergence of carbapenem resistant gramnegative bacilli has
      become a problem of public health worldwide, because it is associated with
      high mortality rates, increased levels of resistance to other
      antimicrobials, increased potential for dissemination transition and
      increase in health care costs. AIM: To characterize multiresistant
      gram-negative bacilli, isolated in patients hospitalized in health
      institutions of Barranquilla (Colombia). METHODS: A descriptive study was
      conducted on the phenotypic and genotypic characterization of bacterial
      resistance in infections associated with health care, mediated by
      carbapenemases in bacterial isolates sent by laboratories belonging to the
      laboratory network of the Department of Atlántico. RESULTS: KPC was the
      most frequent carbapenemase in Enterobacterales (27.6%), predominantly in
      Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.1%) alone and associated with other
      carbapenemases. In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, VIM carbapenemase (32.8%)
      predominated and OXA in Acinetobacter baumannii (17.1%). CONCLUSION: A
      wide distribution of multi-resistant strains producing carbapenemases in
      Atlantic health institutions was found, which expressed the following
      resistance mechanisms: KPC, VIM, NDM, OXA.

      carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae, BD MAX Check-Points CPO (CPO
      assay) and Xpert Carba-R assay, with culture confirmed by polymerase chain
      reaction as the reference method. Using 867 samples from 627 patients, the
      overall sensitivity, specificity, total positive predictive value, and
      negative predictive value of the CPO assay were 95.7%, 96.5%, 60.8% and
      99.8% and for the Xpert assay were 97.9%, 99.8%, 95.8%, and 99.9%,
      respectively. The cycle threshold values (Ct value) of the false-positive
      CPO assay results were significantly higher than those of true-positive
      cases (P < 0.001). By applying a modified cut-off Ct value of 37.3 for
      klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPC), the positive predictive value
      for KPC was improved from 52.9% to 89.5%. The CPO assay will be useful
      when handling many specimens, as tests are conducted in batches. However,
      positive cases showing high Ct values should be confirmed by another assay
      to rule out false positivity.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Given the international spread of multidrug-resistant
      Gram-negative bacteria the need for prompt and precise characterization of
      underlying resistance traits has evolved into the cornerstone of infection
      control strategies. Novel commercial molecular tests enable rapid
      simultaneous testing for multiple resistance genes. We aimed to evaluate
      the performance of OpGen's Acuitas® Resistome Test and the Acuitas
      Lighthouse® software. METHODS: The test is tailored towards detecting 46
      β-lactamase genes (SHV and TEM variants associated with wild-type
      penicillin resistance, extended-spectrum β-lactamases [ESBLs], acquired
      AmpCs and carbapenemases) via a microfluidic polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR) array. In total 118 isolates part of the collection of the
      Bacteriology Laboratory of the Hellenic Pasteur Institute, specifically 96
      enterobacterial isolates and 21 Acinetobacter baumannii, of divergent
      origins, with previously characterized β-lactamase content, were tested.
      RESULTS: In the enterobacterial group all 69 carbapenemase genes of the
      KPC, VIM, NDM and OXA-48 types were correctly identified (sensitivity,
      specificity, positive predictive value [PPV] and negative predictive value
      [NPV] of 100%). Non-ESBL SHV enzymes, ESBLs (CTX-M, GES, VEB types) and
      acquired AmpC enzymes were also correctly characterized. Of the 35
      SHV-ESBLs harboured, correct identification was possible in 32/35
      isolates, with overall sensitivity, specificity, PPV and NPV for the
      Klebsiella pneumoniae group of 89.29%, 100%, 100% and 91.18%,
      respectively. For the A. baumannii group the test exhibited an overall
      sensitivity for carbapenemase detection of 96.55% and 100% PPV.
      CONCLUSIONS: The OpGen Acuitas Resistome Test is an efficient molecular
      tool that can identify resistance threats in health care institutions with
      high diagnostic accuracy and be integrated into targeted surveillance
      protocols.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The worldwide spread of organisms with antimicrobial
      resistance is of concern, especially the trend of significantly increasing
      carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE). In this study, we
      investigated the annual trend of intestinal CPE carriage rates in
      inpatients and healthy adults in a primary care hospital in Tenri, Japan.
      METHODS: We collected 551 samples of feces from inpatients in our
      institution and 936 samples from healthy people living in Tenri city from
      December 2012 to April 2015. All samples were cultured on MacConkey agar
      plates containing 4 μg/mL ceftazidime for screening test. The colonies
      grown on the screening medium were detected for carbapenemase genes
      (bla(IMP-1), bla(IMP-2), bla(VIM), bla(KPC), bla(GES), bla(NDM), and
      bla(OXA-48) groups) by multiplex PCR, and CPE were identified by MALDI-TOF
      MS. Plasmid replicon typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
      were performed on PCR-positive strains. RESULTS: The CPE carriage rate was
      1.6% (9/551) in the inpatient group and 0% (0/936) in the healthy adults
      group. The numbers of strains positive for the carbapenemase gene were 4
      for Enterobacter cloacae, 2 for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 for Citrobacter
      freundii, 1 for Raoultella ornithinolytica and 1 for Escherichia coli. In
      all CPE strains, the carbapenemase gene was bla(IMP-6) and the plasmid
      replicon type was IncN. The 4 E. cloacae strains showed a similar pattern
      in PFGE. CONCLUSION: In the same city in Japan, CPE intestinal carriers
      were detected only in the inpatient group in this study but not in a
      healthy adults, suggesting that the spread of asymptomatic CPE carriers
      was confined to inpatients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to phenotypically investigate the
      expression of the enzyme Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) in a
      Proteus mirabilis sample resistant to carbapenems, isolated from the wound
      of a patient with a venous leg ulcer (VLU) treated at an outpatient
      referral service. METHOD: This was a case study conducted with a patient
      who had a VLU on the lower left limb. Samples were taken for the
      examination of microbiological material from the patient's wound, using an
      aseptic technique. The colonies extracted were submitted to Gram staining
      and biochemical tests to identify the strain. In addition, an
      antimicrobial susceptibility test, E-test and a modified Hodge test were
      performed. RESULTS: The identified microorganism was Proteus mirabilis,
      which showed resistance to cefuroxime and the carbapenems imipenem and
      meropenem. As well as the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of
      3.0μg/ml for imipenem, demonstrating resistance, there was no KPC
      production by the tested isolate, which presented a negative modified
      Hodge test. CONCLUSION: The results highlight the importance of
      microbiological surveillance, aimed at reducing morbidity and mortality
      rates associated with infection by multiresistant bacteria.

AB  - Background: To examine the clinical, demographic, and microbiologic
      characteristics of new rectal carbapenemase-producing carbapenem-resistant
      Enterobacterales (CP-CRE) carriers vs. those with a clinical infection,
      hospitalized at Padeh-Poriya Medical Center between 2014 and 2017 and to
      examine the susceptibility profiles of isolates from clinical infections.
      Methods: In this retrospective, chart analysis, demographic and clinical
      data were collected from medical charts of 175 adult patients with either
      new- onset carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) carriage or
      clinical CPE infection. Collected data included age, ethnic group, place
      of residence, hospitalizations in the past 90 days, and 30-day mortality.
      Microbiological analyses considered bacterial genus, molecular resistance
      mechanism and antibiotic susceptibility. Results: A significantly higher
      percentage (42.4%) of CPE carriers were long-term care facility residents,
      and had been recently hospitalized (56.3%), as compared to patients with
      clinical CPE infection (29.2 and 45.9%, respectively). Additionally, we
      noted a high (58.3%) acquision of CPE in our hospital. The most common
      bacterial isolate was K. pneumoniae and the most common resistance
      mechanism was Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) carbapenemases (KPC).
      High susceptibility rates to amikacin and chloramphenicol were also noted.
      Conclusions: This study reaffirmed the importance of CPE screening and
      infection control measures. The observed antibiotic susceptibility profile
      suggests amikacin and chloramphenicol as potential treatments for CPE
      infection.

AB  - Hospital-acquired infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative
      bacteria (CRGNB) have been increasingly reported worldwide and are
      associated with high rates of mortality especially in intensive care
      units(ICUs). Early identification through rectal surveillance cultures and
      implementation of infection control measures(ICM) including contact
      precautions, staff education on cleaning and hand hygiene may reduce the
      spread of these microorganisms. The aim of this work was to assess the
      impact of enhanced ICM on CRGNB colonization and to describe the molecular
      epidemiology of these bacteria in a polyvalent ICU in a tertiary level
      hospital. A prospective study including audits and active surveillance
      culture program, with molecular characterization, was conducted before and
      after the implementation of prevention programs and infection control
      measures. Microbiological screening was performed in chromogenic media;
      PCR targeting β-lactamases genes (bla(KPC), bla(NDM), bla(VIM) and
      bla(OXA-48), bla(SHV) and bla(CTX-M)), molecular typing by PFGE; and MLST
      in K. pneumoniae were performed. CRGNB colonization was reduced from
      16.92% to 9.67% upon implementing the infection control measures. In K.
      pneumoniae the most frequent carbapenemase type was KPC-2 associated with
      SHV-2 and CTX-M-15, and was disseminated in various STs (ST17, ST13,
      ST2256, ST353); there was no persistence of particular clones and
      virulence factors showed no association with hypervirulence. IMP-1
      carbapenemase predominated in A. baumannii and the PFGE analysis
      individualized 3 clusters, assuming that the dissemination in the ICU was
      clonal. The early detection of patients colonized with CRBGN by using
      epidemiological surveillance cultures and the implementation of
      prophylactic measures are key to reducing the incidence of these
      microorganisms.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Carbapenem resistance has emerged inEscherichia coli,
      including sequence type 131 (ST131) and its fluoroquinolone-resistant H30R
      subclone, the leading cause of extraintestinal E. coli infections
      globally. Meropenem/vaborbactam (MVB) is a recently approved
      carbapenem/β-lactamase inhibitor combination with broad-spectrum
      inhibition of β-lactamases, including serine carbapenemases. The activity
      of MVB against carbapenem-resistant (CR) E. coli infections in relation to
      phylogenetic background, resistance genotype and geographical region is
      unknown. METHODS: We characterised 140 contemporary CR clinicalE. coli
      isolates from 17 non-US countries (2003-2017) for phylogroup, clonal group
      (including ST131, H30R and the CTX-M-15-associated H30Rx subset), relevant
      β-lactamase genes, and broth microdilution MICs for MVB and 11
      comparators. RESULTS: Overall, MVB was moderately active (66%
      susceptible), more so than all comparators except tigecycline and amikacin
      (100% and 74% susceptible, respectively). Most MVB-non-susceptible
      isolates carried metallo-β-lactamase or OXA-48 resistance genes. MVB's
      activity varied significantly in relation to phylogroup, clonal
      background, resistance genotype and global region: it was greatest among
      phylogroup F, ST131-H30R, H30Rx, Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase
      (KPC)-positive and Latin American isolates, and lowest among phylogroup
      B1, metallo-β-lactamase gene-containing and Asia-West Pacific region
      isolates. Enhancement of meropenem's activity by vaborbactam was most
      evident for isolates from phylogroups B2, C and D, and those containing
      KPC. MVB retained appreciable (albeit somewhat reduced) activity against
      isolates resistant to comparator agents. CONCLUSION: MVB should be useful
      for treating international CRE. coli infections, largely independent of
      other resistance phenotypes, although this likely will vary with the local
      prevalence of specific E. coli lineages and carbapenem resistance
      mechanisms.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There has been an increase in the number of
      carbapenemase-producing organisms documented across the UK over the past
      10 years. From these, the 'big five' carbapenemases (KPC, OXA-48, IMP,
      VIM, and NDM) are the most common types reported in the order
      Enterobacterales, identified from a variety of reactive screening,
      outbreak, inpatient surveillance, and diagnostic samples. AIM: To perform
      a point prevalence study to determine the inpatient carriage rate of
      carbapenemase-producing organisms at Barts Health NHS Trust, which
      encompasses 2.5 million patients across four London boroughs: Tower
      Hamlets, Newham, Redbridge, and Waltham Forest. METHODS: Rectal swabs were
      collected from consenting inpatients, alongside details of the ward's
      medical specialty, patient's country of birth, history of foreign travel,
      length of hospitalization, and history of prior hospitalization. Swabs
      were enriched and subcultured on to mSuperCARBA selective medium. All
      Enterobacterales, Acinetobacter, and Pseudomonas species were identified
      by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass
      spectroscopy and underwent antibiotic susceptibility testing by disc
      diffusion, according to European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility
      Testing (EUCAST) guidelines. All isolates were screened for the 'big five'
      carbapenemases using a modified version of a published reverse
      transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay. FINDINGS: Of the 977
      inpatients tested, 35 CPOs were isolated from 30 patients. NDM was the
      most frequently detected carbapenemase, followed by OXA-48, with an
      overall prevalence of 3.1%. Organisms isolated included Klebsiella
      pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli.
      Renal and elderly care patients had the highest prevalences of CPOs,
      whereas the intensive care unit prevalence was low. Statistical analysis
      found that hospitalization abroad, any previous hospitalization, foreign
      travel and, specifically, travel to India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh were
      associated with increased risk of CPO carriage. CONCLUSION: The overall
      prevalence of CPOs at Barts Health Trust was 3.1%, comprising NDM and
      OXA-48-type carbapenemases, which is in line with other London-based
      studies. Renal patients and the elderly had the highest burden of CPOs,
      whereas previous hospitalization and foreign travel were associated with
      an increased risk of CPO carriage.

AB  - Infections due to multidrug resistant Gram-negative pathogens are of great
      concern worldwide, as they are frequently associated with high mortality
      and morbidity rates. The occurrence of Pseudomonas spp. producing
      Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPCs) imposes a great challenge
      through treatment course of bloodstream infections (BSIs). Pseudomonas
      putida has been recognized as an emerging pathogen of healthcare
      associated infections (HAIs). Therefore, we aimed to report a case of a
      non-fatal case of peripheral line associated BSI (PLA-BSI) in an
      immunocompromised host due to P. putida harboring blaKPC-2 gene in Brazil.
      A P. putida isolate was recovered from a blood culture of a 72-year-old
      man admitted at a University Hospital, identified by BD Phoenix™ 100
      (Becton, Dickinson and Company), causing PLA-BSI. The species
      identification was confirmed by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption
      Ionization-Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and resistance
      to carbapenems were confirmed by Epsilometer test (E-test®). Additionally,
      the presence of important carbapenemases genes (blaKPC, blaNDM,
      blaOXA-48-like, blaSPM, blaIMP, blaVIM) was investigated by Polymerase
      Chain Reaction. The bacterial isolate was confirmed as meropenem resistant
      P. putida harboring blaKPC-2 gene.Thereofre, these fidings suggest that P.
      putida can work as a reservoir for resistance genes as this bacterium has
      the ability to disseminate through water-fluids inside hospital and
      community settings. Moreover, this paper highlights that a frequent and
      worldwide disseminated mechanism of resistance (blaKPC-2) is currently
      occurring among uncommon agents of BSI.

AB  - Imipenem-relebactam (I-R) is a recently developed
      carbapenem-beta-lactamase inhibitor combination agent that can overcome
      carbapenem resistance, which has now emerged in Escherichia coli,
      including sequence type 131 (ST131) and its fluoroquinolone-resistant H30R
      subclone, the leading cause of extraintestinal E. coli infections
      globally. To clarify the likely utility of I-R for carbapenem-resistant
      (CR) E. coli infections in the United States, we characterized 203 recent
      CR clinical E. coli isolates from across the United States (years 2002 to
      2017) for phylogroup, clonal group (including ST131, H30R, and the
      CTX-M-15-associated H30Rx subset within H30R), relevant beta-lactamase
      genes, and broth microdilution MICs for I-R and 11 comparator agents.
      Overall, I-R was highly active (89% susceptible), more so than all
      comparators except tigecycline and colistin (both 99% susceptible). I-R's
      activity varied significantly in relation to phylogroup, clonal
      background, resistance genotype, and region. It was greatest among
      phylogroup B2, ST131-H30R, H30Rx, Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase
      (KPC)-positive, and northeast U.S. isolates and lowest among phylogroup C,
      New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM)-positive, and southeast U.S. isolates.
      Relebactam improved imipenem's activity against CR isolates within each
      phylogroup-especially groups A, B1, and B2-and particularly against
      isolates containing KPC. I-R remained substantially active against
      isolates coresistant to comparator agents, albeit somewhat less so than
      against the corresponding susceptible isolates. These findings suggest
      that I-R should be useful for treating most CR E. coli infections in the
      United States, largely independent of coresistance, although this likely
      will vary in relation to the local prevalence of specific E. coli lineages
      and carbapenem resistance mechanisms.

AB  - There is an urgent need for oral agents to combat resistant Gram-negative
      pathogens. Here, we describe the characterization of VNRX-5236, a
      broad-spectrum boronic acid β-lactamase inhibitor (BLI), and its orally
      bioavailable etzadroxil prodrug, VNRX-7145. VNRX-7145 is being developed
      in combination with ceftibuten, an oral cephalosporin, to combat strains
      of Enterobacterales expressing extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) and
      serine carbapenemases. VNRX-5236 is a reversible covalent inhibitor of
      serine β-lactamases, with inactivation efficiencies on the order of 10(4)
      M(-1) · sec(-1), and prolonged active site residence times (t(1/2), 5 to
      46 min). The spectrum of inhibition includes Ambler class A ESBLs, class C
      cephalosporinases, and class A and D carbapenemases (KPC and OXA-48,
      respectively). Rescue of ceftibuten by VNRX-5236 (fixed at 4 μg/ml) in
      isogenic strains of Escherichia coli expressing class A, C, or D
      β-lactamases demonstrated an expanded spectrum of activity relative to
      oral comparators, including investigational penems, sulopenem, and
      tebipenem. VNRX-5236 rescued ceftibuten activity in clinical isolates of
      Enterobacterales expressing ESBLs (MIC(90), 0.25 μg/ml), KPCs (MIC(90), 1
      μg/ml), class C cephalosporinases (MIC(90), 1 μg/ml), and OXA-48-type
      carbapenemases (MIC(90), 1 μg/ml). Frequency of resistance studies
      demonstrated a low propensity for recovery of resistant variants at 4× the
      MIC of the ceftibuten/VNRX-5236 combination. In vivo, whereas ceftibuten
      alone was ineffective (50% effective dose [ED(50)], >128 mg/kg),
      ceftibuten/VNRX-7145 administered orally protected mice from lethal
      septicemia caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae producing KPC carbapenemase
      (ED(50), 12.9 mg/kg). The data demonstrate potent, broad-spectrum rescue
      of ceftibuten activity by VNRX-5236 in clinical isolates of
      cephalosporin-resistant and carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales.

AB  - The increase of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) and lack of
      therapeutic options due to the scarcity of new antibiotics has sparked
      interest toward the use of intravenous fosfomycin against systemic CRE
      infections. We aimed to investigate the in vitro pharmacodynamics of
      fosfomycin against carbapenem-resistant Enterobacter cloacae and
      Klebsiella aerogenes Time-kill studies and population analysis profiles
      were performed with eight clinical CRE isolates, which were exposed to
      fosfomycin concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 2,048 mg/liter. The 24-h
      mean killing effect was characterized by an inhibitory sigmoid maximum
      effect (E(max)) model. Whole-genome sequencing was performed to elucidate
      known fosfomycin resistance mechanisms. Fosfomycin MICs ranged from 0.5 to
      64 mg/liter. The isolates harbored a variety of carbapenemase genes
      including bla(IMP), bla(KPC), and bla(NDM) Five out of eight isolates
      harbored the fosA gene, while none harbored the recently discovered
      fosL-like gene. Heteroresistant subpopulations were detected in all
      isolates, with two out of eight isolates harboring heteroresistant
      subpopulations at up to 2,048 mg/liter. In time-kill studies, fosfomycin
      exhibited bactericidal activity at 2 to 4 h at several fosfomycin
      concentrations (one isolate at ≥16 mg/liter, two at ≥32 mg/liter, two at
      ≥64 mg/liter, two at ≥128 mg/liter, and one at ≥512 mg/liter). At 24 h,
      bactericidal activity was only observed in two isolates (MICs, 0.5 and 4
      mg/liter) at 2,048 mg/liter. From the E(max) model, no significant
      bacterial killing was observed beyond 500 mg/liter. Our findings suggest
      that the use of fosfomycin monotherapy may be limited against CRE due to
      heteroresistance and rapid bacterial regrowth. Further optimization of
      intravenous fosfomycin dosing regimens is required to increase efficacy
      against such infections.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The production of β-lactamases by Gram-negative bacteria is
      among the most important factors of resistance to antibiotics, which has
      contributed to therapeutic failures that currently threaten human and
      veterinary medicine worldwide. Antimicrobial photodynamic therapy and
      antimicrobial blue light have a broad-spectrum antibacterial activity
      against multidrug-resistant and hypervirulent pathogens. OBJECTIVE: To
      investigate the ability of antimicrobial blue light to inhibit the
      hydrolytic activity of clinically relevant β-lactamase enzymes (i.e., KPC,
      IMP, OXA, CTX-M, and SHV), with further comparison of the inhibitory
      effects of antimicrobial blue light with methylene blue-mediated
      antimicrobial photodynamic therapy. METHODS: Blue LED light (λ = 410 ± 10
      nm) alone or red LED light (λ = 660 ± 10 nm) in combination with methylene
      blue were used to inactivate, in vitro, suspensions of Klebsiella
      pneumoniae strains producing clinically important β-lactamase enzymes
      assigned to the A, B and D Ambler molecular classes. Furthermore,
      β-lactamase activity inhibition mediated by antimicrobial blue light and
      methylene blue-mediated antimicrobial photodynamic therapy was measured by
      using the chromogenic β-lactam substrate nitrocefin. RESULTS: β-lactamase
      activities were effectively inactivated by both visible light-based
      approaches. In this regard, antimicrobial blue light and methylene
      blue-antimicrobial photodynamic therapy led to a significant reduction in
      the hydrolysis of nitrocefin (81-98 %). CONCLUSION: Sublethal doses of
      antimicrobial blue light and methylene blue-mediated antimicrobial
      photodynamic therapy are equally effective to inhibit clinically
      significant β-lactamases, including extended-spectrum β-lactamases and
      carbapenemases.

AB  - BACKGROUND Spontaneous pneumothorax can be secondary to a wide variety of
      lung diseases. Spontaneous pneumothorax secondary to pulmonary
      tuberculosis occurs in rare cases of residual fibrosis with retractions
      and bullae. CASE REPORT We present the case of a 65-year-old male patient
      from a rural area in the province of Los Ríos in Babahoyo, Ecuador, with
      no history of contact with tuberculosis. The patient arrived at the
      Emergency Department of the Regional Hospital of the Instituto Ecuatoriano
      de Seguridad Social (IESS), Babahoyo, due to acute respiratory failure,
      preceded by 10 days of evolution due to cough accompanied by greenish
      expectoration, chest pain, asthenia, and weight loss. On chest
      radiography, a left pneumothorax and interstitial pulmonary infiltrate
      were reported. A chest tube was placed, and the patient was intubated and
      was placed on invasive mechanical ventilation due to severe respiratory
      failure. Use of the GeneXpert MTB/RIF System detected Mycobacterium
      tuberculosis without resistance to rifampicin. Ziehl-Neelsen (ZN) staining
      for the identification of bacillus acid-resistant alcohol was positive in
      alveolar bronchial lavage. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and phenotypic
      analysis showed the presence of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Klebsiella
      pneumonia with carbapenemases resistance mechanism, and the KPC type
      enzyme was identified. The culture for Mycobacterium tuberculosis was
      positive from the fourth week. CONCLUSIONS Secondary pneumothorax due to
      rupture of the polymicrobial cavity and especially of tuberculous origin
      is a very special form of acute respiratory failure in patients with
      previous structural pulmonary lesions in the Emergency Department.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The production of carbapenem-hydrolyzing β-lactamases is one
      of the most concerning resistance mechanisms since it eliminates the last
      therapeutic option against multidrug resistant microorganisms. AIM: To
      determine the production of KPC and NDM-1 type carbapenemases, using
      phenotypic and genotypic methods, in isolated enterobacteria in a clinical
      laboratory in the city of Maracay, Venezuela. METHODS: The production of
      carbapenemases was determined by phenotypic (according to the Malbrán
      algorithm) and genotypic methods (amplification of the blaNDM-1 and blaKPC
      genes by PCR) in clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae during the period
      March-August 2018. RESULTS: 605 Enterobacteriaceae of different species
      were identified, being Escherichia coli the strain with the highest
      percentage of isolation (61.3%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae
      (14.9%). Sixteen strains (2.64%) were positive for carbapenemases
      production: 13 strains of K. pneumoniae and three of the Enterobacter
      cloacae complex. PCR showed that 14 strains (87.5%) carry the blaNDM-1
      gene and two strains (12.5%) the blaKPC gene; 100% agreement was observed
      between phenotypic determination and PCR for both groups of enzymes.
      CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed a higher incidence of
      metallo-β-lactamase type NDM-1, which rapid dissemination and consequently
      difficult control has been cause of epidemiological alert. The
      identification of the type of enzyme would allow establishing more
      accurate management and control strategies in order to eradicate these
      pathogens.

AB  - PURPOSE: Tigecycline is an agent for carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella
      pneumonia (KPC-KP), given its penetration into lung tissues. Our study
      focused on the molecular and clinical efficacy of tigecycline for
      hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) in the ICU. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A
      retrospective cohort study of 52 adult KPC-KP HAP patients by searching
      hospital medical records from January 2018 to December 2020 was
      established to investigate the epidemiology of KPC-KP infections for
      tigecycline treatment and the associated clinical efficacy of tigecycline.
      The KPC-KP isolates underwent multilocus sequence typing. Molecular
      typing, antimicrobial resistance, and virulence profiling were also
      analyzed by whole-genome sequencing of KPC-KP. RESULTS: Among 52 patients
      with KPC-KP, the ICU mortality rate was 14/52 (27%), and there was no
      significant statistical difference in mortality between the effective
      group and failure group (p = 0.754). However, the duration of tigecycline
      was statistically different between the two groups of patients (14.4 vs 10
      days, p=0.046). The total bacterial clearance rate was 6/52 (11.5%). There
      was no significant statistical difference in both groups (p=0.416).
      Antibiotic resistance genes (aac3iia) and virulence gene (AREO-iutA,
      Capsule-wzc) were negatively correlated with clinical efficacy (p = 0.011,
      OR = 1.237). CONCLUSIONS: Bla(kpc) was the main carbapenemase in all K.
      pneumoniae strains. ST11-KL64 KPC-KP was the most common virulence factors
      in KPC-KP isolates. This study suggested that antibiotic resistance genes
      (aac3iia) and virulence gene (AREO-iutA, Capsule-wzc) were independent
      mortality risk factors for patients with Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenemase-2 producing K. pneumoniae infections, when during the
      tigecycline treatment. Molecular analysis of K. pneumoniae may provide an
      option when choosing the antimicrobial treatment.

AB  - IntroductionIn contrast to countries where carbapenemase-producing
      Enterobacterales (CPE) are endemic, only sporadic cases were reported in
      Switzerland until 2013. An aggravation of the epidemiological situation in
      neighbouring European countries indicated the need for a surveillance
      study in Switzerland.AimWe aimed to describe CPE distributions in
      Switzerland and identify epidemiological factors associated with changes
      in incidence.MethodsData on all human CPE isolates from 2013 to 2018 were
      collected by the Swiss Centre for Antibiotic Resistance (ANRESIS) and
      analysed for temporal and regional trends by Generalised Poisson
      regression. Isolates associated with infection or colonisation were
      included in a primary analysis; a secondary analysis included invasive
      isolates only. Statistical detection of regional clusters was performed
      with WHONET/SaTScan.ResultsWe analysed 731 CPE isolates, of which 325
      (44.5%) were associated with screenings and 173 (23.7%) with infections.
      Yearly detection of CPE isolates increased considerably during the study
      period from 65 to 212. The most frequently isolated species were
      Klebsiella pneumoniae (54%) and Escherichia coli (28%). The most frequent
      genotypes were OXA-48 (43%), KPC (21%) and NDM (14%). In contrast to the
      French-speaking parts of Switzerland (West, Geneva) where OXA-48 were the
      predominant genotypes (around 60%), KPC was the most frequently detected
      genotype in the Italian-speaking region (63%). WHONET/SaTScan outbreak
      detection analysis identified seven clusters in five regions of
      Switzerland.ConclusionsIn a first continuous surveillance of CPE in
      Switzerland, we found that the epidemiological situation aggravated
      nationwide and that regional patterns of CPE genotypes mirrored the
      situation in neighbouring European countries.

AB  - This study focused on Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates that were resistant
      or had low susceptibility to a combination of ceftazidime/avibactam. We
      aimed to investigate the mechanisms underlying this resistance. A total of
      24 multi-drug resistant isolates of K. pneumoniae were included in the
      study. The phenotypic determination of carbapenemase presence was based on
      the CARBA NP test. NG-Test CARBA 5 was also performed, and it showed KPC
      production in 22 out 24 strains. The molecular characterisation of blaKPC
      carbapenemase gene, ESBL genes (blaCTX-M, blaTEM, and blaSHV) and porin
      genes ompK35/36 was performed using the PCR. Finally, ILLUMINA sequencing
      was performed to determine the presence of genetic mutations.Various types
      of mutations in the KPC sequence, leading to ceftazidime/avibactam

      that KPC-31 harboured the D179Y mutation, the deletion of the amino acids
      167-168, and the mutation of T243M associated with ceftazidime/avibactam
      resistance. The isolates that did not present carbapenemase alterations
      were found to have other mechanisms such as mutations in the porins. The
      mutations both on the KPC-3 enzyme and in the porins confirmed, that
      diverse mechanisms confer resistance to ceftazidime/avibactam in K.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Meropenem/vaborbactam has been approved in Europe for the
      treatment of hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia, ventilator-associated
      pneumonia (VAP) and bacteraemia among other indications. Vaborbactam is an
      inhibitor of class A and C β-lactamases, including Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenemase (KPC) enzymes, but not class B or D carbapenemases. We
      analysed the activity of meropenem/vaborbactam and comparators against
      6846 Enterobacterales and 3567 Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates from
      patients hospitalized with pneumonia (PHP), including VAP. METHODS:
      Isolates from PHP were consecutively collected during 2014-19 from 42
      European hospitals located in 21 countries and susceptibility tested using
      the broth microdilution method. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales
      (CRE) isolates were molecularly characterized to identify their
      carbapenem-resistance mechanisms. EUCAST (2020) interpretive criteria were
      used. RESULTS: The most common Gram-negative pathogens isolated from PHP
      were P. aeruginosa (n = 3567), K. pneumoniae (n = 1877) and Escherichia
      coli (n = 1646). Overall, 98.0% of Enterobacterales and 82.1% of P.
      aeruginosa were susceptible to meropenem/vaborbactam, with 99.8% of
      Enterobacterales and 89.7% of P. aeruginosa in Western Europe (WE) and
      92.7% of Enterobacterales and 69.1% of P. aeruginosa in Eastern Europe
      (EE). CRE were more common in EE (15.1%) than WE (2.1%). KPC was the most
      common carbapenemase in WE, while OXA-48-like was the most common
      carbapenemase in EE. Meropenem/vaborbactam susceptibility was 63.0% for
      all CRE (92.2% in WE and 51.5% in EE). Meropenem/vaborbactam inhibited
      99.1% of KPC-producing isolates and 40.5% of OXA-48-like-producing
      isolates. CONCLUSIONS: These in vitro data demonstrate that
      meropenem/vaborbactam has potent activity against isolates from PHP,
      including isolates producing KPC, and may be a useful treatment option for
      PHP, including VAP.

AB  - Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae represent an increasing global
      threat worldwide and Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing
      K. pneumoniae (KPC-KP) has become one of the most important contemporary
      pathogens, especially in endemic areas. Risk stratification and rapid
      diagnostics laboratory workflows are of paramount importance and
      indication for therapy of KPC-KP infection must be individualized
      according to the baseline characteristics of the patient and severity of
      infection. The optimal treatment of infection because of KPC-KP organisms
      is uncertain and antibiotic options are limited. The knowledge of the
      patient's pathophysiology, infection site, and application of the
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles on the basis of minimum
      inhibitory concentration (MIC) has progressively gained major relevance.
      Combination therapies including high-dose meropenem, colistin, fosfomycin,
      tigecycline, and aminoglycosides are widely used, with suboptimal results.
      In the past few years, new antimicrobials targeting KPC-KP have been
      developed and are now at various stages of clinical research. However,
      their optimal use should be guaranteed in the long term for delaying, as
      much as possible, the emergence of resistance. Strict infection control
      measures remain necessary. The aim of this review is to discuss the
      challenges in the management and treatment of patients with infections

AB  - The spread of multi-drug resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria, including
      Klebsiella pneumoniae, constitutes a global threat. The most frequent
      mechanism of acquired carbapenem resistance is the production of
      carbapenemases, especially KPC, NDM, VIM, IMP and OXA-48. We analyzed the
      epidemiological trend of carbapenem resistance genes of
      carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP) strains isolated from critically
      ill patients in a Greek tertiary hospital. The study included 150 CRKP
      isolates collected from 116 (77.4%) patients hospitalized in the adult ICU
      and 17 (11.3%) each in the pediatric and the two neonatal ICUs between
      March 2018 and March 2021. Identification and antimicrobial susceptibility
      testing were performed using VITEK-2. A multiplex lateral flow immunoassay
      was used for the detection of carbapenemases, while the detection of bla
      VIM, bla KPC, bla NDM, bla IMP and bla OXA-48-like genes was achieved by
      multiplex PCR. The bla NDM was mainly detected in adults (54/116, 46.9%),
      while in children the most often detected gene was bla KPC (24/34, 70.6%).
      The predominant carbapenem resistance gene during 2018-2019 was bla KPC
      alone or in combination with bla VIM, reaching 44.4% in 2019, while during
      2020-2021 the detection of bla NDM prevailed significantly, reaching 45.5
      and 60.7% for 2020 and 2021, respectively. A shift in the molecular
      epidemiology of CRKP was seen during 2018-2021, which is probably
      associated with the recent excessive empiric use of newer antimicrobials.
      Surveillance studies and proper and strict implementation of infection
      control measures are highly needed to decrease the spread of MDR bacteria,
      including CRKP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ceftazidime/avibactam (CZA)-resistant carbapenem-resistant
      Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) infections occur in adults worldwide but are
      rarely observed in neonates. We evaluated the activities of CZA against
      CRKP and described the clinical and molecular epidemiology of
      CZA-resistant CRKP in a NICU prior to CZA approval in China. METHODS: A
      laboratory-based surveillance of CRKP was conducted from July 2017 to June
      2018. Clinical data were initially reviewed. Antimicrobial susceptibility
      was determined by the broth microdilution method. CZA-resistant CRKP
      isolates were submitted to carbapenemase types screening and multilocus
      sequence typing. RESULTS: Over 23.3% (10/43) of CRKP strains were
      resistant to CZA, MIC(50) and MIC(90) values being 0.5 μg/mL and >32μg/mL,
      respectively. Most neonates shared similar clinical features with cesarean
      (n=8), preterm birth (n=6), low birth weight (n=5), and exposure to
      carbapenems/β-lactam (n=8). All CZA-resistant CRKP isolates were highly
      resistant to most tested drugs except for polymyxin B (POL) and
      tigecycline (TGC). CZA-resistant CRKP isolates showed greater sensitivity
      to amikacin (AMK), nitrofurantoin (NIT), levofloxacin (LVX) and
      ciprofloxacin (CIP), compared with CZA-sensitive CRKP. All CZA-resistant
      CRKP isolates harbored carbapenemase genes, bla(kpc-2) (n=5) being
      predominant, followed by bla(NDM-1) (n=4) and bla(NDM-5) (n=2). Among
      these CZA-resistant CRKP isolates, a total of eight different STs were
      identified. CRKP harboring KPC belonged to ST1419, ST37 and ST11, while
      NDM types were assigned to ST784, ST1710, ST37 and ST324. Furthermore,
      other β-lactamase genes including bla(SHV) and bla(CTX-M) were also found.
      CONCLUSION: Over 23.3% of CRKP strains isolated from neonates were
      resistant to CZA. Cesarean, preterm birth, low birth weight, and exposure
      to carbapenems/β-lactam were similar clinical features of most neonates
      with CZA-resistant CRKP. The predominant carbapenemases of CZA-resistant
      CRKP were KPC-2 and NDM-1, and KPC-2 producing K. pneumoniae assigned into
      3 STs, which indicate the genetic diversity of clinical CZA-resistant CRKP
      isolates.

AB  - The nosocomial spread of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) is
      extremely common, resulting in severe burdens on healthcare systems. In
      particular, the high-risk Klebsiella pneumoniae ST11 strain has a wide
      endemic area in China. The current study describes the results of
      continuous monitoring of CRE genotypes and phenotypes in a tertiary
      hospital in North China from 2012 to 2020. A total of 160 isolates were
      collected, including 109 Klebsiella. pneumoniae (68.13%), 29 Escherichia
      coli (26.60%), 12 Enterobacter cloacae (7.50%), and 10 other strains
      (6.25%). A total of 149 carbapenemase genes were detected, of which
      bla(KPC)(-2) (51.0%) was the most common, followed by bla(NDM)(-1)
      (22.82%), and bla(NDM)(-5) (23.49%). Based on multi-locus sequence typing,
      the ST11 strain (66.1%) dominates K. pneumoniae, followed by ST15 (13.8%).
      Interestingly, the proportion of bla(NDM) (22.2%, 16/72) in ST11 K.
      pneumoniae was significantly increased in 2018-2019. Hence, whole-genome
      sequencing was performed on ST11 K. pneumoniae. Growth curves and in vitro
      competition experiments showed that K. pneumoniae carrying bla(NDM)
      exhibited a stronger growth rate (p < 0.001) and competition index (p <
      0.001) than K. pneumoniae carrying bla(KPC). Moreover, K. pneumoniae
      carrying bla(NDM) had a stronger biofilm-forming ability than K.
      pneumoniae carrying bla(KPC) (t = 6.578; p < 0.001). K. pneumoniae
      carrying bla(KPC) exhibited increased defense against bactericidal
      activity than K. pneumoniae carrying bla(NDM). Thus, ST11 K. pneumoniae
      carrying bla(NDM) has strong adaptability and can locally replace K.
      pneumoniae carrying bla(KPC) to become an epidemic strain. Based on these
      findings, infection control and preventive measures should focus on the
      high-risk ST11-K. pneumoniae strain.

AB  - In this study, we investigated the characteristics of KPC-2-producing
      Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP-Kp) isolates from a hospital in South Korea.
      Among the 37 KP-Kp isolates, two main clones were identified-ST11 and
      ST307. ST11 isolates showed higher minimum inhibitory concentrations for
      carbapenems than ST307 isolates. All ST307 isolates were resistant to
      gentamicin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, but ST11 isolates were not.
      However, most tigecycline-resistant or colistin-resistant isolates
      belonged to ST11. The two KP-Kp clones showed different combinations of
      wzi and K serotypes. Plasmids from ST11 KP-Kp isolates exhibited diverse
      incompatibility types. Serum resistance and macrophage infection assays
      indicated that ST11 may be more virulent than ST307. The changes in the
      main clones of KP-Kp isolates over time as well as the different
      characteristics of these clones, including virulence, suggest the need for
      their continuous monitoring.

AB  - The carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) strains have been
      identified by the World Health Organization as critical priority pathogens
      in research and development of diagnostics, treatments, and vaccines.
      However, recent molecular information about carbapenem-resistant K.
      pneumoniae (CRK) epidemiology in Portugal is still scarce. Thus, this
      study aimed to provide the molecular epidemiology, resistome, and virulome
      of CRK clinical strains recovered from a tertiary care hospital centre
      (2019-2021) using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and the advanced
      molecular technique whole-genome sequencing (WGS). PCR amplification of
      carbapenemase genes was performed in 437 carbapenem-resistant K.
      pneumoniae strains. The most frequent carbapenemases were: KPC-3 (42%),
      followed by OXA-181 (20%), GES-5 (0.2%), and NDM-1 (0.2%). Additionally,
      10 strains (2%) coproduced KPC-3 and OXA-181, and 1 strain coproduced
      KPC-3 and OXA-48 (0.2%). The genomic population structure of 68 strains
      characterized by WGS demonstrated the ongoing dissemination of four main
      high-risk clones: ST13, ST17, ST147, and ST307, while no clones belonging
      to the European predominant clonal groups (CG15 and CG258) were found.
      Moreover, we describe one K. pneumoniae ST39-KL62 that coproduced the
      NDM-1 carbapenemase and the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase CTX-M-15, and
      one K. pneumoniae ST29-KL54 GES-5 and BEL-1 coproducer. Furthermore, a
      high prevalence of iron siderophores were present in all CRK strains, with
      several strains presenting both colibactin and the hypermucoviscosity
      phenotype. Thus, the data presented here highlight an uncommon molecular
      epidemiology pattern in Portugal when compared with most European
      countries, further supporting the emergence and dissemination of nonclonal
      group 258 hypervirulent multidrug high-risk clones and the need to promote
      in-depth hospital molecular surveillance studies.

AB  - We evaluated the in vitro effectiveness of temocillin and several commonly
      used antimicrobials against Enterobacterales bacteria in isolates from
      Polish patients. We tested 400 isolates: 260 extended-spectrum β-lactamase
      (ESBL)- and/or ampC β-lactamase (AmpC)-producing isolates; 40 Klebsiella
      pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing isolates; and 100 ESBL-, AmpC-,
      and KPC-negative isolates. The minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of
      temocillin and 16 other antimicrobials were determined by reference
      microdilution. We also determined the activities of fosfomycin and
      ceftazidime/avibactam in KPC-producing isolates. The antibiotic
      sensitivities were interpreted according to EUCAST, BSAC, and CLSI
      criteria. Overall, 91% of the isolates were susceptible to temocillin
      using the urinary tract infection breakpoint (≤ 32 mg/L), and 61.8% were
      susceptible using the systemic infection breakpoint (≤ 8 mg/L). Meropenem
      and imipenem were the most active drugs (MIC(50) values of 0.06 and 0.5
      mg/L, respectively). Colistin and ertapenem (both MIC(50) = 0.12 mg/L)
      were less active than meropenem or imipenem, but some strains were 77%
      susceptible to each of them. Among the KPC-producing isolates, 42.5% had
      MIC values of ≤ 32 mg/L (urinary tract infection breakpoint), but 100%
      were resistant to temocillin (systemic infection breakpoint).
      Ceftazidime/avibactam was active against 100% of the KPC-producing
      isolates, and fosfomycin was active against 40%. The empirical
      susceptibility rate observed among the urinary isolates suggests that
      temocillin may be considered as an alternative to carbapenems in the
      absence of KPC-producing bacteria. With regard to isolates from other
      sources, temocillin might be useful as a documented therapy agent or an
      empirical treatment in hospitals with a low prevalence of
      ESBL/AmpC-producing strains.

AB  - Antibiotic-resistant bacteria originating from hospitals are ultimately
      discharged to municipal wastewater treatment plants (WWTP), which may
      serve as important reservoirs for the spread of antibiotic resistant
      genes. This study traced and quantified the presence of a rare but
      clinically relevant antimicrobial resistance gene; Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenamase (KPC)-and the viable organisms (KPCO) which carried this
      gene in hospital, non-hospital wastewater discharges, various compartments
      within a municipal WWTP, receiving water and sediment samples. High
      concentration of the gene, bla(KPC) harbored in viable and multispecies
      KPCO was detected in the hospital wastewater and in the forepart stages of
      the WWTP, but was not detected in the final effluent following UV
      disinfection. KPCO were not detected in multiple non-hospital sources of
      wastewater discharges tested. The treatment train used in the sampled WWTP
      was found to help remove and reduce KPCO load. Using whole-genome
      sequencing, a KPC-producing Klebsiella oxytoca strain identical to strains
      seen in the patients and hospital environment was isolated from the
      downstream receiving water on one sampling event. KPCO were also found to
      persist in the biosolids throughout the WWTP, but were not detected in the
      processed compost-products made from WWTP-biosolids. This study
      systematically demonstrates dissemination of KPCO from hospital point
      source to environment via municipal WWTP. Understanding hospitals as the
      origin and source of spread of some of the most clinically urgent
      antimicrobial-resistant organisms may help direct interventions that
      target rate at which antibiotic resistant bacteria evolve and spread via
      enhancement of wastewater treatment and mitigation of dissemination at
      source.

AB  - Ceftazidime/avibactam is an important treatment option for infections
      caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae
      (KPC-Kp), however, resistance can emerge during treatment. The objective
      of the study was to define the ceftazidime/avibactam concentrations
      required to suppress bacterial regrowth in ceftazidime/avibactam
      susceptible isolates and identify active therapies against
      ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant KPC-Kp. Time-kill assays were performed
      against twelve ST258 KPC-Kp isolates that harbored bla (KPC) (-) (2) or
      bla (KPC) (-) (3). Nine KPC-Kp isolates (KPC-Kp 5A, 6A, 7A, 8A, 9A, 24A,
      25A, 26A, and 27A) were susceptible to ceftazidime/avibactam, two (KPC-Kp
      6B and 7B) were ceftazidime/avibactam resistant and meropenem susceptible,
      and one (KPC-Kp 1244) was resistant to both ceftazidime/avibactam and
      meropenem. Sequencing of the bla (KPC) genes revealed mutations in KPC-Kp
      6B (D179Y substitution) and 7B (novel 21 base pair deletion) that both
      affected the Ω-loop encoding portion of the gene. Time-kill assays showed
      that against ceftazidime/avibactam-susceptible KPC-Kp,
      ceftazidime/avibactam concentrations ≥40/7.5 mg/L caused mean 5.42 log(1)
      (0)CFU/mL killing and suppressed regrowth. However, regrowth occurred for
      some KPC-Kp isolates with a ceftazidime/avibactam concentration of 20/3.75
      mg/L. Against ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant and meropenem-susceptible
      KPC-Kp 6B and 7B, bactericidal activity and synergy was observed for
      ceftazidime/avibactam in combination with meropenem ≤3.125 mg/L, while
      meropenem concentrations ≥50 mg/L were bactericidal as monotherapy. In
      contrast, clinically achievable concentrations of ceftazidime/avibactam
      were bactericidal against KPC-Kp 1244, which was
      ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant and meropenem-resistant due to outer
      membrane porin mutations and elevated bla (KPC) expression. Achieving high
      ceftazidime/avibactam concentrations may help to suppress bacterial
      regrowth in the presence of ceftazidime/avibactam. The optimal treatment
      approach for ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant KPC-Kp likely depends on the
      mechanism of resistance. Additional studies are warranted to confirm these
      findings.

AB  - PURPOSE: Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) represents a
      serious problem worldwide. Herein, we describe the evolution of
      ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA) resistance by sequencing clinical isolates
      from a patient with CRKP infection undergoing CZA treatment. PATIENTS AND
      METHODS: In this study, six CRKP strains were isolated from sputum and
      blood samples of a patient with CRKP infection after intracerebral
      hemorrhage. Two strains were selected for whole-genome analysis. RESULTS:
      Drug susceptibility testing showed that the MIC of CZA for CRKP strains
      isolated after 6 days of CZA treatment was 64-fold higher than that for
      three CRKP strains isolated before CZA treatment (4 vs >256 μg/mL),
      whereas the MIC of imipenem and meropenem was 128-fold (>32 vs 0.25 μg/mL)
      and 16-fold (> 32 vs 2 μg/mL) lower relatively, respectively. Multilocus
      sequence typing showed that all six CRKP strains isolated from the patient
      were ST11 and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis confirmed that they were of
      the same clone. Two strains were selected for whole-genome analysis. The
      aspartic acid residue at position 179 in the Ω loop was replaced by a
      tyrosine residue in the resistant strain, and the plasmid carried a bla
      (KPC-2) to bla (KPC-33) mutation. The results of the modified carbapenem
      inactivation method and the carbapenemase inhibitor enhancement and
      colloidal gold enzyme immunochromatographic assays for bla (KPC-33) were
      negative. CONCLUSION: This is the first report from Henan to show that
      treatment with CZA for 6 days can cause mutations and change the phenotype
      from CZA sensitive to resistant. Therefore, routine testing for drug
      susceptibility and carbapenemase phenotypes should be conducted during
      treatment with CZA, and genotype determination is essential.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase 2 (KPC-2) is a serine β-lactamase that
      can hydrolyze almost all β-lactam antibiotics. The drug resistant problem
      of bacteria expressing carbapenemases is currently a global problem,
      therefore, rapid and specific detection of pathogenic bacteria is urgent.
      In order to obtain an aptamer that can specifically recognize bacteria
      expressing KPC-2, we have established a method called Precision-SELEX.
      Precision-SELEX combined protein SELEX and bacterium SELEX. In this
      method, KPC-2 was used as a target protein, and Escherichia coli
      expressing KPC-2 (KPC-2 E. coli) was used as a target bacterium. After
      precision-SELEX, the same aptamer named XK-10 that can recognize KPC-2 and
      KPC-2 E. coli was obtained while the screening process could be shortened
      to 4 rounds. Dissociation equilibrium constants were calculated as 0.81 nM
      by SPR. In addition, XK-10 could specifically bind to KPC-2 E. coli, which
      was confirmed through flow cytometry and molecular Docking Simulations.
      The high-content imaging method could detect KPC-2 E. coli. In all, the
      Precision-SELEX provides an accurate and efficient method to screening
      aptamers for bacteria.

AB  - Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an opportunistic Gram-negative pathogen with an
      increase in the frequency of infections caused by multidrug resistant
      (MDR) and extensively drug resistant (XDR) strains, limiting the available
      therapeutic options. The most troublesome resistance is the acquisition
      and production of carbapenemases such as Verona integron-encoded
      metallo-β-lactamases (VIM), the most frequent and widespread, and the
      Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPC), which has continuously spread
      in the last decade. Its dissemination is linked to their location on
      mobile genetic elements (MGEs). In Colombia, VIM and KPC have been
      increasing in its frequency showing major successful dissemination. In
      this article, we molecularly characterized and analyzed the genetic
      context of bla (VIM) and bla (KPC) in carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa
      (CRPA) isolates from infected and colonized patients in two tertiary-care
      hospitals, one in Medellín and the other in a municipality close to
      Medellín, both areas with high carbapenemase endemicity in Colombia
      (2013-2015). Using whole-genome sequencing (WGS), we identified a
      remarkable variety of genetic backgrounds in these MDR P. aeruginosa
      isolates carrying bla (KPC-) (2) and bla (VIM-) (2). There were a
      diversity of class 1 integron and variations in the gene cassettes
      associated to bla (VIM-) (2), as well as a possible event of spread of bla
      (KPC-) (2) mediated by a plasmid that contained part of Tn4401b in one
      infection case. The dissemination of bla (VIM-) (2) and bla (KPC-) (2) in
      P. aeruginosa in this area in Colombia has been strongly influenced by
      successful international clones, carrying these genes and additional
      determinants of resistance on MGEs, accompanied by gene rearrangement
      under an antimicrobial selection pressure. These findings emphasize the
      need to implement control strategies based on rational antibiotic use.

AB  - The prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa is
      increasing. Identification of carbapenemase-producing P. aeruginosa will
      have therapeutic, epidemiological, and infection control implications.
      This study evaluated the performance of the EDTA-modified carbapenem
      inactivation method (eCIM) in tandem with the modified carbapenem
      inactivation method (mCIM) against a large collection of clinical P.
      aeruginosa isolates (n = 103) to provide clinicians a phenotypic test that
      not only identifies carbapenemase production but also distinguishes
      between metallo-β-lactamase and serine-carbapenemase production in P.
      aeruginosa The mCIM test was performed according to Clinical and
      Laboratory Standards Institute guidelines, while the eCIM was conducted as
      previously described for Enterobacteriaceae Test performance was compared
      to the genotypic profile as the reference. mCIM testing successfully
      categorized 91% (112/123) of P. aeruginosa isolates as carbapenemases or
      non-carbapenemase producers, with discordant isolates being primarily
      Guiana extended-spectrum (GES)-type producers. To increase the sensitivity
      of the mCIM for GES-harboring isolates, a double inoculum, prolonged
      incubation, or both was evaluated, with each modification improving
      sensitivity to 100% (12/12). Upon eCIM testing, all Verona
      integrin-encoded metallo-β-lactamases (VIM; n = 27) and New Delhi
      metallo-β-lactamases (NDM; n = 13) tested had 100% concordance to their
      genotypic profiles, whereas all Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC;
      n = 8) and GES (n = 12) isolates tested negative, as expected, in the
      presence of EDTA. The eCIM failed to identify all imipenemase
      (IMP)-producing (n = 22) and Sao Paulo metallo-β-lactamase (SPM)-producing
      (n = 14) isolates. KPC-, VIM-, and NDM-producing P. aeruginosa were well
      defined by the conventional mCIM and eCIM testing methods; additional
      modifications appear required to differentiate GES-, IMP-, and
      SPM-producing isolates.

AB  - Emergence of bla (NDM-1) and bla (KPC-2) co-producing Klebsiella
      pneumoniae strains is currently attracting widespread attention, but
      little information is available about their tigecycline resistance,
      virulence, and prevalence in Southwest China. In July 2021, an extensively
      drug-resistant K. pneumoniae strain AHSWKP25 whose genome contained both
      bla (NDM-1) and bla (KPC-2) genes was isolated from the blood of a patient
      with the malignant hematological disease in Luzhou, China. We investigated
      the resistance profiles of AHSWKP25 using microbroth dilution, agar
      dilution, modified carbapenemase inactivation (mCIM), and EDTA-modified
      carbapenemase inactivation methods (eCIM). The virulence of AHSWKP25 was
      assessed through string tests, serum killing assays, and a Galleria
      mellonella larval infection model. Conjugation and plasmid stability
      experiments were conducted to determine the horizontal transfer capacity
      of plasmids. And efflux pump phenotype test and real-time quantitative
      reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) were used to determine its efflux pump
      activity. Sequencing of AHSWKP25 determined that AHSWKP25 belonged to
      ST464, which is resistant to antibiotics such as carbapenems,
      tetracycline, fluoroquinolones, tigecycline, and fosfomycin. The efflux
      pump phenotype tests and RT-PCR results demonstrated that efflux pumps
      were overexpressed in the AHSWKP25, which promoted the tigecycline
      resistance of the bacteria. AHSWKP25 also showed hypervirulence and serum
      resistance in vitro model. AHSWKP25 carried several different plasmids
      that contained bla (NDM-1), bla (KPC-2,) and mutated tet(A) genes.
      Sequence alignment revealed that the plasmids carrying bla (NDM-1) and bla
      (KPC-2) underwent recombination and insertion events, respectively. We
      demonstrated that an X3 plasmid carrying bla (NDM-1) was transferred from
      pSW25NDM1 to E. coli J53. We also identified missense mutations in the
      ramR, rcsA, lon, and csrD genes of AHSWKP25. Our results highlighted the
      potential of bla (NDM-1) and bla (KPC-2) co-producing K. pneumoniae
      strains to further develop antimicrobial resistance and hypervirulent
      phenotypes, but measures should be taken to closely monitor and control
      the spread of superbugs with multidrug-resistant phenotypes and
      hypervirulence.

AB  - Objectives: This study aimed to explore changes in carbapenem-resistant
      Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-KP) isolates collected in Guangdong over the
      period of 2016-2020. Methods: Antibacterial susceptibility was quantified
      through VITEK 2 compact and K-B method. Carbapenemase phenotypes and
      genotypes were characterized by modified carbapenem inactivation method
      (mCIM), EDTA-carbapenem inactivation method (eCIM), and polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR). Molecular characteristics and evolutionary trends were
      analyzed by multilocus sequence typing and evolutionary tree. Results:
      Isolates (2,847) of K. pneumoniae were separated in 2016-2020, and the
      separate rate of CR-KP increased from 5.65 to 9.90% (p = 0.009). The top 3
      wards were intensive care unit (ICU) (21.92%), neonatal wards (13.70%),
      and respiratory wards (12.33%). In 146 CR-KP strains, serine carbapenemase
      was the main phenotype, and KPC was the main genotype, and 57 contained
      two resistant genes, and 1 contained three resistant genes. Two polygenic
      strains were first found: IMP + GES and KPC + NDM + VIM, but all the
      phenotypes were metalloenzyme, which indicated that metalloenzyme was
      usually the first choice for CR-KP resistance. In addition, all the ST54
      of metalloenzyme type contained IMP, and all the ST45, ST37, and ST76
      contained OXA. ST11 was the most prevalent (42.47%); ST11 and its mutants
      proved the predominant sequence type making up 51.1% of the
      carbapenemase-producing isolates. A novel type of ST11 mutation, the rpoB
      was mutated from sequence 1 to sequence 146, was in an independent
      separate branch on the evolutionary tree and was resistant to all
      antibacterial agents. The other three mutants, rpoB 1-15, infB 3-148, and
      infB 3-80, are also resistant to all antibacteria. Of note, all the four
      mutants produced serine carbapenemase and contained KPC, and indicated
      that the prevalent strain in China, ST11, has serious consequences and
      potential outbreaks. Conclusion: The infection rate of CR-KP has
      increased, and ICU and neonatal wards have become the key infection areas.
      Producing serine enzyme, the KPC genotype, and ST11 are the predominant
      CR-KP. Polygenic strains and ST11 mutation made clinical treatment
      difficult and may become a potential threat.

AB  - Meropenem/vaborbactam (M/V) is a new carbapenem-carbapenemase inhibitor
      combination drug active against extensively drug resistant Gram-negative
      pathogens. Studies about its efficacy and place in therapy are limited in
      "real-life" and no data are available for deep site infections, like
      vascular graft infections. We present a case of a patient successfully
      treated with M/V for a thoracic aorta graft infection, placed for a
      traumatic penetrating aortic ulcer, due to an extensively KPC-producing
      Klebsiella pneumoniae resistant to ceftazidime/ avibactam. Furthermore, we
      conducted a systematic literature review concerning vascular graft
      infections caused by carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and the
      papers published until now about the use of M/V for the treatment of
      ceftazidime/avibactam-resistant K. pneumoniae. Meropenem/vaborbactam is a
      promising antibiotic for difficult-to-treat Gram-negative bacteria with
      limited therapeutic options. Only few reports have been published and more
      studies are needed to assess which is the best place in therapy of M/V.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Ceftazidime/avibactam (CZA) is a new option for the treatment
      of KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. The aim of this study was to
      determine resistance patterns and carbapenemase genes among K. pneumoniae
      (CP-Kp) bacteremic isolates before and after CZA introduction. METHODS: K.
      pneumoniae from blood cultures of patients being treated in a Greek
      university hospital during 2015-21 were included. PCR for bla(KPC),
      bla(VIM), bla(NDM) and bla(OXA-48) genes was performed. RESULTS: Among 912
      K. pneumoniae bacteremias: 725 (79.5%) were due to carbapenemase-producing
      isolates; 488 (67.3%) carried bla(KPC); 108 (14.9%) bla(VIM); 100 (13.8%)
      bla(NDM); and 29 (4%) carried a combination of bla(KPC), bla(VIM) or
      bla(NDM). The incidence of CP-Kp bacteremias was 59 per 100,000
      patient-days. The incidence of CP-Kp changed from a downward pre-CZA trend
      to an upward trend in the CZA period (p = 0.007). BSIs due to
      KPC-producing isolates showed a continuous downward trend in the pre-CZA
      and CZA periods (p = 0.067), while BSIs due to isolates carrying bla(VIM)
      or bla(NDM) changed from a downward trend in the pre-CZA to an upward
      trend in the CZA period (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: An abrupt change in the
      epidemiology of CP-Kp was observed in 2018, due to the re-emergence of
      VIM-producing isolates after the suppression of KPC-producing ones via the
      use of CZA.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The spread of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE)
      strains has caused treatment failure and is a worldwide threat to public
      health. However, there are limited reports on the prevalence of
      carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) in aquatic environments and
      its association with clinical isolates. This study aimed to investigate
      the prevalence of CPE in a stream environment and its genetic relationship
      with clinical isolates in Korea. METHODS: A total of 4,582 water samples
      were collected from 94 streams. Multiplex PCR and sequencing were used to
      detect and identify six carbapenemase genes. Multi-locus sequence typing
      (MLST) was performed to investigate the genetic relatedness between the
      environmental strains and clinical isolates. RESULTS: A total of 133 CRE
      strains were isolated from the streams. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most
      common CRE (45.9%), followed by Enterobacter cloacae complex (29.3%),
      Escherichia coli (13.5%), Raoultella ornithinolytica (5.3%), and
      Citrobacter freundii (2.3%). Ninety (67.7%) isolates carried carbapenemase
      genes. K. pneumoniae carbapenemase-2 (36.7%) and New Delhi
      metallo-β-lactamase-5 (32.2%) were the common carbapenemases detected.
      Sequence type (ST)307 and ST11 K. pneumoniae strains harboring the bla
      (KPC-2) gene were the most prevalent in stream and patient samples.
      CONCLUSION: CPE was highly prevalent in streams and closely related to the
      isolates obtained from patients. Therefore, continuous monitoring of
      stream environments is required to control the spread of carbapenem
      resistance.

AB  - The rapid spread of carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (cpKP)
      poses serious threats to public health, however, the underlying genetic
      basis for its dissemination is still unknown. We conducted a comprehensive
      genomic epidemiology analysis on 420 cpKP isolates collected from 70
      hospitals in 24 provinces of China during 2009-2017 by short-/long-read
      sequencing. The results showed that most cpKP isolates were categorized
      into clonal group 258 (CG258), in which ST11 was the dominant clone.
      Phylogenetic analysis revealed three major clades including the top one of
      Clade 3 for CG258 cpKP isolates. Additionally, carbapenemase gene analysis
      indicated that bla(KPC) was dominant in the cpKP isolates, and most
      bla(KPC) genes were located in five major incompatibility (Inc) groups of
      bla(KPC)-harboring plasmids. Importantly, three advantageous combinations
      of host-bla(KPC)-carrying plasmids (Clade 3.1 + 3.2-IncFII(pHN7A8), Clade
      3.1 + 3.2-IncFII(pHN7A8):IncR, and Clade
      3.3-IncFII(pHN7A8):Inc(pA1763-KPC)) were identified to confer cpKP
      isolates the advantages in both genotypes (strong
      correlation/co-evolution) and phenotypes (resistance/growth/competition)
      to facilitate the nationwide spread of ST11/CG258 cpKP. Intriguingly,
      Bayesian skyline analysis illustrated that the three advantageous
      combinations might be directly associated with the strong population
      expansion during 2007-2008 and subsequent maintenance of the population of
      ST11/CG258 cpKP after 2008. We then examined drug resistance profiles of
      these cpKP isolates and proposed combination treatment regimens for
      CG258/non-CG258 cpKP infections. Thus, the findings of our systematical
      analysis shed light on the molecular epidemiology and genetic basis for
      the dissemination of ST11/CG258 cpKP in China, and much emphasis should be
      given to the close monitoring of advantageous cpKP-plasmid combinations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Nosocomial carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterieceae (CPE)
      infections constitute a major global health concern and are associated
      with increased morbidity and mortality. Rectal colonization with CPE is a
      risk factor for bacterial translocation leading to subsequent endogenous
      CPE infections. This prospective observational study was aimed to
      investigate the prevalence and epidemiology of rectal colonization of CPE,
      the carbapenemase genotypes, and to identify the independent risk factors
      for the acquisition of CPE colonization in high-risk patients from ICU and
      HSCT wards in a university hospital in China. METHODS: In a prospective
      cohort study, 150 fecal samples from rectal swabs were consecutively
      obtained for inpatients from the intensive care unit (ICU) and
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) wards from November 2018 to
      May 2019, and screening test for CPE was conducted by using prepared
      in-house trypsin soybean broth (TSB) selective media and MacConkey agar.
      Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the broth microdilution
      method and carbapenemase genes were characterized by both the GeneXpert
      Carba-R and PCR for bla(KPC), bla(NDM), bla(IMP), bla(VIM) and bla(OXA).
      Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) was employed to characterize the
      genetic relationships among the carbapenemase-producing K. Pneumonia
      (CPKP) isolates. In order to further investigate the risk factors and
      clinical outcomes of CPE colonization, a prospective case-control study
      was also performed. RESULTS: Twenty-six suspected CPE strains, including
      17 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 6 Escherichia coli, 1 Citrobacter freundii, 1
      Enterobacter Kobe, and 1 Raoultella ornithinolytica, were identified in 25
      non-duplicated rectal swab samples from 25 patients, with a carriage rate
      of 16.67% (25/150). Through GeneXpert Carba-R and subsequent PCR and
      sequencing, all the suspected CPE isolates were identified to be positive
      for the carbapenemase genes, of which 17 were bla(KPC)-carriers, and
      another 9 were bla(NDM)-producers. MLST designated all the CPKP isolates
      to be ST11 clone. Multivariate analysis indicated that urinary system
      diseases, operation of bronchoscopy, and combined use of antibiotics were
      independent risk factors for acquiring CPE colonization in high-risk
      patients from the ICU and HSCT wards. CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed a
      high prevalence of rectal CPE colonization in high-risk patients from ICU
      and HSCT wards, and a predominant colonization of the KPC-producing K.
      pneumoniae clone ST11. Stricter infection control measures are urgently
      needed to limit the dissemination of CPE strains, especially in patients
      who were afflicted by urinary system diseases, have underwent
      bronchoscopy, and were previously exposed to combined antibiotic use.

AB  - Rapid diagnosis of infections caused by carbapenem-resistant
      Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) is crucial for proper treatment and infection
      control. The Xpert Carba-R assay is a qualitative multiplex real-time PCR
      method that qualitatively detects and differentiates five common
      carbapenemase genes (bla(KPC), bla(NDM), bla(VIM), bla(OXA-48), and
      bla(IMP)) directly from rectal swabs or purified colonies within
      approximately 1 h. We performed a multicenter evaluation of the
      investigational use of the Carba-R assay for detection and differentiation
      of carbapenemase genes from sputum specimens in patients with a clinical
      diagnosis of pneumonia. The intra- and interassay coefficients of
      variation values for the Carba-R assay were 0.2% to 2.0% and 1.4% to 2.3%,
      respectively. A total of 301 sputum specimens were collected and tested.
      Compared to bacterial culture followed by PCR identification of resistance
      genes from colonies, the Carba-R assay reduced turnaround time from 56 to
      84 h to less than 2 h. Carbapenemase genes were detected by the Carba-R
      assay in Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 236), Escherichia coli (n = 22),
      Enterobacter cloacae (n = 23), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 8), Serratia
      marcescens (n = 6), Citrobacter freundii (n = 4), and Klebsiella aerogenes
      (n = 2). The Carba-R assay detected 112 bla(KPC) (33.5%), 70 bla(NDM)
      (21.0%), 8 bla(IMP) (2.4%), and 2 bla(VIM) (0.6%) genes, with positive
      percent agreement, negative percent agreement, and concordance rates of
      92.9%, 86.7%, and 88.3%, respectively, for the dominant bla(KPC) and
      85.0%, 87.8%, and 87.4%, respectively, for the bla(NDM) genes. Neither
      method detected the bla(OXA-48) carbapenemase gene. The convenient, rapid,
      and simple characteristics of the Xpert Carba-R assay make it a potential
      tool for CRE detection and identification directly in sputum specimens.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The increased frequency of bacteraemias caused by
      pandrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (PDR-Kp) has significant
      implications. The aim of the present study was to identify predictors
      associated with mortality of PDR-Kp bacteraemias. METHODS: Patients with
      monomicrobial bacteraemia due to PDR-Kp were included. K. pneumoniae was
      considered PDR if it showed resistance to all available groups of
      antibiotics. Primary outcome was 30-day mortality. Minimum inhibitory
      concentrations (MICs) of meropenem, tigecycline, fosfomycin, and
      ceftazidime/avibactam were determined by Etest, whereas for colistin, the
      broth microdilution method was applied. bla (KPC), bla (VIM), bla (NDM),
      and bla (OXA) genes were detected by PCR. RESULTS: Among 115 PDR-Kp
      bacteraemias, the majority of infections were primary bacteraemias (53;
      46.1%), followed by catheter-related (35; 30.4%). All isolates were
      resistant to tested antimicrobials. bla (KPC) was the most prevalent
      carbapenemase gene (98 isolates; 85.2%). Thirty-day mortality was 39.1%;
      among 51 patients with septic shock, 30-day mortality was 54.9%.
      Multivariate analysis identified the development of septic shock, Charlson
      comorbidity index, and bacteraemia other than primary or catheter-related
      as independent predictors of mortality, while a combination of at least
      three antimicrobials was identified as an independent predictor of
      survival. CONCLUSIONS: Mortality of PDR-Kp bloodstream infections was
      high. Administration of at least three antimicrobials might be beneficial
      for infections in critically ill patients caused by such pathogens.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular
      mechanisms of imipenem resistance in Enterobacteriaceae and to assess the
      antimicrobial activities of ceftazidime/avibactam (CAZ/AVI) and
      aztreonam/avibactam (ATM/AVI) against imipenem-resistant clinical isolates
      in a tertiary hospital in China. METHODS: A total of 91 imipenem-resistant
      Enterobacteriaceae were collected and genes encoding carbapenemases,
      ESBLs, AmpC β-lactamases and porins were detected using PCR. MICs and
      susceptibility were determined using in-house-prepared broth microdilution
      panels and were interpreted according to CLSI breakpoints. RESULTS:
      Imipenem-resistant isolates comprising 54 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 18
      Escherichia coli, 8 Enterobacter cloacae, 6 Serratia marcescens, 3
      Klebsiella oxytoca and 2 Klebsiella aerogenes were collected
      independently. Five different carbapenemase genes were identified, namely
      bla(KPC-2) (n = 60), bla(NDM-5) (n = 14), bla(NDM-1) (n = 11), bla(KPC-3)
      (n = 4) and bla(IMP-4) (n = 1). Among the 91 carbapenem-resistant
      Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), 85 isolates harboured at least one ESBL and/or
      AmpC gene, including 5 strains without carbapenemase-encoding genes.
      Moreover, 31 K. pneumoniae carried ompK35 and/or ompK36 mutations. MLST
      results showed that the K. pneumoniae belonged to 12 different STs, with
      ST11 being predominant (29/54; 53.7%). Overall, 17.6%, 25.3%, 41.8%, 65.9%
      and 100% of the CRE strains were susceptible to amikacin,
      trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, CAZ/AVI and ATM/AVI,
      respectively. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that CRE isolates differ
      significantly in their species, STs, porins and carbapenemase genes in a
      single Chinese hospital. ATM/AVI exhibited potent activity against CRE
      isolates, even for the most notorious double-carbapenemase-producers with
      porin defects, whereas CAZ/AVI was active against all the
      non-metallo-β-lactamase-producing isolates.

AB  - Objectives: The study aimed to characterize the clonal spread of resistant
      bacteria and dissemination of resistance plasmids among
      carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales at a tertiary hospital in Catalonia,
      Spain. Methods: Isolates were recovered from surveillance rectal swabs and
      diagnostic samples. Species identification was by matrix-assisted laser
      desorption ionization-time time of flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF
      MS). Molecular typing was performed by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis
      (PFGE) and multi-locus sequence typing (MLST). Antimicrobial
      susceptibility was assessed by gradient-diffusion and carriage of bla
      genes was detected by PCR. Plasmid typing, conjugation assays, S1-PFGE
      studies and long-read sequencing were used to characterize resistance
      plasmids. Results: From July 2018 to February 2019, 125 Klebsiella
      pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Enterobacterales were recovered
      from 101 inpatients from surveillance (74.4%) or clinical samples (25.6%),
      in a tertiary hospital in Barcelona. Clonality studies identified a major
      clone of Klebsiella pneumoniae belonging to sequence type ST15 and
      additional isolates of K. pneumoniae, Escherichia coli and Enterobacter
      sp. from different STs. All isolates but one carried the bla (KPC-2)
      allelic variant. The bla (KPC-2) gene was located in an IncFIIk plasmid of
      circa 106 Kb in a non-classical Tn4401 element designated
      NTE(KPC)-pMC-2-1. Whole-genome sequencing revealed different
      rearrangements of the 106 Kb plasmid while the NTE(KPC)-pMC-2-1 module was
      highly conserved. Conclusion: We report a hospital outbreak caused by the
      clonal dissemination of KPC-producing ST15 K. pneumoniae but also the
      intra- and inter-species transmission of the bla (KPC-2) gene associated
      with plasmid conjugation and/or transposon dissemination. To our
      knowledge, this is the first report of an outbreak caused by KPC-producing
      Enterobacterales isolated from human patients in Catalonia and highlights
      the relevance of surveillance studies in the early detection and control
      of antibiotic resistant high-risk clones.

AB  - PURPOSE: The search for new agents to treat multidrug-resistant
      gram-negative bacterial infections has been ongoing. Specifically,
      carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) infections often exhibit
      multiple resistance mechanisms, including alterations in drug structure,
      bacterial efflux pumps, and drug permeability. Vaborbactam, a cyclic
      boronic acid pharmacophore, has the highest potency in vitro with
      meropenem as an inhibitor of class A carbapenemases, including Klebsiella
      pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC). This combination product was approved by
      the US Food and Drug Administration for complicated urinary tract
      infections (cUTIs) in August 2017, and recent Phase III trial data have
      expanded the literature available. This article aimed to describe the
      literature regarding spectrum of activity, dosing and administration,
      including pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics properties, safety profile,
      and efficacy end points. METHODS: The terms meropenem, vaborbactam,
      RPX7009, and meropenem-vaborbactam were used to search for literature via
      PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, and published abstracts from 2013 to July
      2019. Abstracts from IDWeek 2019 were also searched via these terms.
      Results were limited to availability in English. FINDINGS:
      Meropenem-vaborbactam covers a spectrum of gram-negative bacterial
      pathogens, including K pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter
      cloacae complex. Although the addition of vaborbactam to meropenem results
      in MIC lowering for KPC-positive Enterobacteriaceae, in vitro data reveal
      limited activity against resistant strains of Acinetobacter species and
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Data from 2 Phase III studies compare the drug
      with available therapies for the following indications: cUTIs, acute
      pyelonephritis, hospital-acquired and ventilator-acquired bacterial
      pneumonia, bacteremia, and complicated intra-abdominal infections.
      Outcomes include an improvement in clinical success when compared with
      piperacillin-tazobactam (98.4% vs 94%; 95% CI, 0.7%-9.1%; P < 0.001 for
      noninferiority) for overall treatment of cUTIs and acute pyelonephritis
      and clinical cure (64.3% vs 33.3%; P = 0.04) when compared with best
      available therapy for CRE infections in various sites of infection.
      Adverse events have been described as mild to moderate, with few events
      requiring discontinuation of the drug therapy. IMPLICATIONS: Currently,
      meropenem-vaborbactam is approved for treatment of cUTIs and acute
      pyelonephritis; however, off-label use, in particular for CRE infections,
      appears beneficial. Clinical trials to date have found an improvement in
      clinical cure and potentially an improved tolerability compared with
      standard therapies. Most of the evidence for meropenem-vaborbactam
      activity and the role in therapy focuses on KPC-producing organisms;
      however, because in vitro activity has been found with some
      non-KPC-producing CRE, its role may be further described from upcoming in
      vivo cases and postmarketing research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with COVID-19 may be at increased risk for secondary
      bacterial infections with MDR pathogens, including carbapenemase-producing
      Enterobacterales (CPE). OBJECTIVES: We sought to rapidly investigate the
      clinical characteristics, population structure and mechanisms of
      resistance of CPE causing secondary infections in patients with COVID-19.
      METHODS: We retrospectively identified CPE clinical isolates collected
      from patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March and April 2020
      at our medical centre in New York City. Available isolates underwent
      nanopore sequencing for rapid genotyping, antibiotic resistance gene
      detection and phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: We identified 31 CPE
      isolates from 13 patients, including 27 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 4
      Enterobacter cloacae complex isolates. Most patients (11/13) had a
      positive respiratory culture and 7/13 developed bacteraemia; treatment
      failure was common. Twenty isolates were available for WGS. Most K.
      pneumoniae (16/17) belonged to ST258 and encoded KPC (15 KPC-2; 1 KPC-3);
      one ST70 isolate encoded KPC-2. E. cloacae isolates belonged to ST270 and
      encoded NDM-1. Nanopore sequencing enabled identification of at least four
      distinct ST258 lineages in COVID-19 patients, which were validated by
      Illumina sequencing data. CONCLUSIONS: While CPE prevalence has declined
      substantially in New York City in recent years, increased detection in
      patients with COVID-19 may signal a re-emergence of these highly resistant
      pathogens in the wake of the global pandemic. Increased surveillance and
      antimicrobial stewardship efforts, as well as identification of optimal
      treatment approaches for CPE, will be needed to mitigate their future
      impact.

AB  - We evaluated the activity of meropenem-vaborbactam against different
      beta-lactamase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli
      isolates. In our study antibiotic susceptibility testing, double disk
      synergy test, modified Hodge test were applied. Detection of ESBL, AmpC,
      and carbapenemase genes was performed by PCR. Multilocus sequence typing
      (MLST) analysis was done on OXA-48 producing K. pneumoniae strains. Our
      results showed that among E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates, 41.1% and
      40% of strains produced ESBL, respectively. Additionally, the prevalence
      of AmpC producing K. pneumoniae and E. coli was 4% and 45.5%,
      respectively. Altogether 64.2% of K. pneumoniae strains and one E. coli
      isolate produced carbapenemase. Among OXA-48 producing K. pneumoniae
      strains ST3500 and ST2528 were detected by MLST. Based on the phenotypic
      results of this study, vaborbactam was an effective inhibitor on the
      third-generation cephalosporin-resistant isolates (P < 0.0001).
      Meropenem-vaborbactam combination had the highest efficacy on KPC
      producing strains, and it had limited activity on isolates producing
      OXA-48 type beta-lactamases, whereas no effect was observed on NDM-1
      producing isolates. Our study provided valuable information regarding the
      vaborbactam inhibitory effect on β-lactamase-producing strains.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The prevalence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) among
      Gram-negative bacteria is alarmingly high. Reintroduction of colistin as
      last resort treatment in the infections caused by drug-resistant
      Gram-negative bacteria has led to the emergence and spread of colistin
      resistance. This study was designed to determine the prevalence of
      drug-resistance among beta-lactamase-producing strains of Escherichia coli
      and Klebsiella pneumoniae, isolated from the clinical specimens received
      at a tertiary care centre of Kathmandu, Nepal during the period of March
      to August, 2019. METHODS: A total of 3216 different clinical samples were
      processed in the Microbiology laboratory of Kathmandu Model Hospital.
      Gram-negative isolates (E. coli and K. pneumoniae) were processed for
      antimicrobial susceptibility test (AST) by using modified Kirby-Bauer disc
      diffusion method. Drug-resistant isolates were further screened for
      extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL),
      carbapenemase and K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) production tests. All
      the suspected enzyme producers were processed for phenotypic confirmatory
      tests. Colistin resistance was determined by minimum inhibitory
      concentration (MIC) using agar dilution method. Colistin resistant strains
      were further screened for plasmid-mediated mcr-1 gene using conventional
      polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: Among the total samples
      processed, 16.4% (529/3216) samples had bacterial growth. A total of 583
      bacterial isolates were recovered from 529 clinical samples. Among the
      total isolates, 78.0% (455/583) isolates were Gram-negative bacteria. The
      most predominant isolate among Gram-negatives was E. coli (66.4%; 302/455)
      and K. pneumoniae isolates were 9% (41/455). In AST, colistin, polymyxin B
      and tigecycline were the most effective antibiotics. The overall
      prevalence of multidrug-resistance (MDR) among both of the isolates was
      58.0% (199/343). In the ESBL testing, 41.1% (n = 141) isolates were
      confirmed as ESBL-producers. The prevalence of ESBL-producing E. coli was
      43% (130/302) whereas that of K. pneumoniae was 26.8% (11/41). Similarly,
      12.5% (43/343) of the total isolates, 10.9% (33/302) of E. coli and 24.3%
      of (10/41) K. pneumoniae were resistant to carbapenem. Among 43 carbapenem
      resistant isolates, 30.2% (13/43) and 60.5% (26/43) were KPC and
      MBL-producers respectively. KPC-producers isolates of E. coli and K.
      pneumoniae were 33.3% (11/33) and 20% (2/10) respectively. Similarly,
      63.6% (21/33) of the E. coli and 50% (5/10) of the K. pneumoniae were
      MBL-producers. In MIC assay, 2.2% (4/179) of E. coli and 10% (2/20) of K.
      pneumoniae isolates were confirmed as colistin resistant (MIC ≥ 4 µg/ml).
      Overall, the prevalence of colistin resistance was 3.1% (6/199) and
      acquisition of mcr-1 was 16.6% (3/18) among the E. coli isolates.
      CONCLUSION: High prevalence of drug-resistance in our study is indicative
      of a deteriorating situation of AMR. Moreover, significant prevalence of
      resistant enzymes in our study reinforces their roles in the emergence of
      drug resistance. Resistance to last resort drug (colistin) and the
      isolation of mcr-1 indicate further urgency in infection management.
      Therefore, extensive surveillance, formulation and implementation of
      effective policies, augmentation of diagnostic facilities and
      incorporation of antibiotic stewardship programs can be some remedies to
      cope with this global crisis.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae has become a primary threat to global health because
      of its virulence and resistance. In 2015, China reported
      multidrug-resistant (MDR) and hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKp) isolates.
      The emergence of MDR-hvKp poses a significant threat to public health. We
      collected 76 MDR K. pneumoniae isolates from the same hospital, of which
      there were a total of six MDR-hvKp isolates. We performed multilocus
      sequence typing (MLST) and capsular typing, whole genome sequencing,
      comparative genome analysis, and phylogenetic analysis as well as
      phenotypic experiments, including growth curves, mucoviscosity assay,
      Galleria mellonella infection model, human whole blood survival, and human
      neutrophil bactericidal assay to further characterize the samples. We
      identified six large plasmids carrying extended spectrum β-lactamase
      (ESBL) genes or carbapenemase genes (bla (CTX-M-65), bla (KPC-2), bla
      (SHV-12), bla (SHV-158)), 9 plasmids containing other drug resistance
      genes, and 7 hypervirulence plasmids carrying rmpA and rmpA2 in ST11
      MDR-hvKp isolates. Some of these plasmids were identical, whereas others
      differed only by insertion elements. In addition, we identified a plasmid,
      p21080534_1, that carries hypervirulence genes (iucABCD, iutA, rmpA2), a
      carbapenemase gene (bla (KPC-2)), and an ESBL gene (bla (SHV-12)), as well
      as MDR-hvKp 21072329, which did not carry rmpA or rmpA2, but exhibited
      hypervirulence and hypermucoviscosity. ST11 MDR-hvKp derived from
      hypervirulence and multidrug resistance plasmids not only causes
      significant treatment difficulties, but also represents an unprecedented
      challenge to public health. Therefore, urgent measures are needed to limit
      further spread.

AB  - Objectives: Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K.
      pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) emerge as a major healthcare concern worldwide.
      Despite the significance of infections before and after allogeneic
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (alloHCT), the burden of KP infections
      has not been extensively evaluated. Methods: We studied the incidence,
      risk factors, and outcomes of consecutive alloHCT recipients with Kp
      isolates before and after alloHCT. Results: Among 424 patients who
      underwent alloHCT in 2008-2018, we studied two groups: those with Kp
      isolates before (group 1, 52 patients) and those with Kp isolates after
      alloHCT (group 2, 66 patients). prE-transplant infections were associated
      with post-transplant infections (p = 0.010), despite secondary
      prophylaxis. KPC-Kp was isolated in 29% of group 1, and 80% of group 2.
      Both groups were characterized by a significant burden of moderate-severe
      acute graft- vs.-host disease (GVHD) [cumulative incidence (CI) of 44.5
      and 61.9%, respectively] and severe chronic (CI of 56.7 and 61.9%). Kp
      infections and GVHD were independent predictive factors of
      treatment-related mortality (TRM) in both groups. Conclusions: Our study
      highlights the significant impact of Kp infections on TRM, with GVHD
      consisting an important underlying factor. As prophylactic measures did
      not improve rates of post-transplant infections, innovative interventions
      need to be further investigated to address this major healthcare concern.

AB  - Carbapenemase-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) is a genuine burden
      for physicians and researchers. We aimed at carbapenemase resistance and
      its relation with capsular serotyping in K. pneumoniae and studied some
      clinical determinants, which may influence the clinical infections.
      Initially, 61 K. pneumoniae isolates obtained from various clinical
      specimens were confirmed at the molecular level and then antimicrobial
      susceptibility test was performed followed by capsular serotyping
      performed by multiplex PCR. All isolates were subjected to the detection
      of carbapenemase genes including bla (KPC), bla (NDM-1), bla (OXA-48), bla
      (VIM), and bla (IMP). Clinical and demographic data of all patients were
      reviewed including age, gender, underlying diseases, and the treatment
      obtained. Multidrug-resistance was a predominant feature in 77% K.
      pneumoniae strains. Presence of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase was
      detected phenotypically in 59% K. pneumoniae strains. Carbapenem
      resistance was noticed phenotypically in 24.6% isolates. bla (OXA-48) and
      bla (NDM-1) were the most frequent carbapenemase genes. bla (NDM-1)
      positive isolates correlated with gentamicin, amikacin, imipenem, and
      meropenem resistance (p < 0.05). The nosocomial isolates mostly harbored
      bla (OXA-48) gene (p < 0.02). Amongst all the K. pneumoniae isolates, 59%
      isolates could be typed and serotype K54 had the highest prevalence
      followed by K20 and K5. Correlation between the carbapenemase genes,
      serotype and type of infection showed that bla (OXA-48) positive strains
      had a significant association with K20 serotype and urinary tract
      infections (p=0.2) while, K20 serotype and bla (KPC) positive strains were
      significantly associated with wound infections (K20, p=0.3 and bla (KPC),
      and p=0.4). Mucoid phenotype was not found related to presence of specific
      carbapenemase genes or serotypes except serotype K20 (p < 0.001). Patients
      with monotherapy had treatment failure in comparison to the combination
      therapy for bla (KPC)-associated infections. In conclusion, the present
      investigation exhibited the significant association between K20 serotype
      with bla (OXA-48). The predominance of K54 reveals the possibility of
      endemicity in our hospital setting. K. pneumoniae isolated from wound
      specimens significantly harbors K20 serotype and bla (KPC) gene.
      Comprehensive clinical information and the distribution of antibiotic
      resistance genes, and serotypes may play important roles in the treatment
      process.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing
      Enterobacterales bacteremia is associated with significant mortality;
      however, no optimal antibiotic strategy is available. We aimed to evaluate
      the clinical outcomes according to the antibiotic regimens and identify
      risk factors for mortality in patients with KPC-producing K. pneumoniae
      and Escherichia coli bacteremia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective
      cohort study included all adult patients with monomicrobial bacteremia
      (KPC-producing K. pneumoniae or E. coli) between January 2011 and March
      2021 at a 2,700-bed tertiary center. RESULTS: Ninety-two patients were
      identified; 7 with E. coli bacteremia, and 85 with K. pneumoniae
      bacteremia. Thirty-day mortality was 38.0% (35/92). Non-survivors were
      more likely to have had nosocomial infection (88.6% vs. 63.2%, P = 0.01),
      high APACHE II scores (mean [interquartile range], 22.0 [14.0 - 28.0] vs.
      14.0 [11.0 - 20.5], P <0.001), and septic shock (51.4% vs. 26.3%, P
      <0.001) and less likely to have been admitted to the surgical ward (5.7%
      vs. 22.8%, P = 0.04), undergone removal of eradicable foci (61.5% vs.
      90.6%, P = 0.03), and received appropriate combination treatment (57.1%
      vs. 78.9%, P = 0.03) than survivors. No significant difference in
      mortality was observed according to combination regimens including
      colistin, aminoglycoside, and tigecycline. In multivariable analysis, high
      APACHE II scores (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 1.14; 95% confidence interval
      [CI], 1.06 - 1.23, P <0.001), and appropriate definitive treatment (aOR,
      0.25; CI, 0.08 - 0.74, P = 0.01) were independent risk factors for
      mortality. CONCLUSION: High APACHE II scores and not receiving appropriate
      definitive treatment were associated with 30-day mortality. Mortality did
      not significantly differ according to combination regimens with
      conventional drugs such as aminoglycoside and colistin.

AB  - Carbapenems are used as last-resort drugs to treat infections caused by
      multidrug-resistant bacteria. Despite the increasing number of reports of
      carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), there is still limited
      information on their distribution or prevalence in the environment. Our
      aim was to assess the occurrence of CRE in the Lis river (Portugal) and to
      characterize the genetic platforms linked to carbapenemase genes. We
      collected six water samples from sites near a wastewater treatment plant
      (n = 4 samples) and livestock farms (n = 2). Twenty-four CRE were
      characterized by BOX element-polymerase chain reaction (BOX-PCR), and
      thirteen representative isolates were analysed by Pulsed-Field Gel
      Electrophoresis (PFGE) and by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. Antimicrobial
      susceptibility testing, PCR screening for carbapenemase-encoding genes,
      conjugation experiments and plasmid analysis were performed. Four isolates
      were chosen for whole-genome sequencing. All water samples contained CRE
      (4.0 CFU/mL on average). Representative isolates were multidrug-resistant
      (resistant to ciprofloxacin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and to all
      β-lactams tested) and were identified as K. pneumoniae, Enterobacter and
      Citrobacter. Isolates carried plasmids and harboured
      carbapenemase-encoding genes: bla(KPC-3) in K. pneumoniae (n = 9),
      bla(NDM-1) in Enterobacter (n = 3) and bla(GES-5) in Citrobacter (n = 1).
      Conjugation experiments were successful in two Klebsiella isolates.
      Enterobacter PFGE profiles grouped in one cluster while Klebsiella were
      divided in three clusters and a singleton. Whole-genome sequencing
      analysis revealed bla(GES-5) within a novel class 3 integron (In3-16)
      located on an IncQ/pQ7-like plasmid in Citrobacter freundii CR16.
      bla(KPC-3) was present on IncFIA-FII pBK30683-like plasmids, which were
      subsequently confirmed in all K. pneumoniae (n = 9). Furthermore,
      bla(KPC-3) was part of a genomic island in K. pneumoniae CR12. In E.
      roggenkampii CR11, bla(NDM-1) was on an IncA/C(2) plasmid. The
      carbapenemase-encoding plasmids harboured other resistance determinants
      and mobile genetic elements. Our results demonstrate that Lis river is
      contaminated with CRE, highlighting the need for monitoring antibiotic
      resistance in aquatic environments, especially to last-resort drugs.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance represents a serious concern to public health,
      being responsible for hospital infections, affecting mainly
      immunosuppressed patients. Thus, nanotechnology appears as an alternative
      to solve this problem, through the application of metallic nanoparticles
      with antimicrobial activity. The present work aims to synthesize and
      characterize AgNPs from Klebsiella pneumoniae (AgNPs-KP) and Aloe vera
      extract (AgNPs-AV), evaluating the antimicrobial activity against
      Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KpC) and the cytotoxicity in the L929
      cell line. AgNPs were prepared by the biosynthetic method using Klebsiella
      pneumoniae and were characterized by XRD, FTIR and SEM-EDS. Antimicrobial
      activity was tested using the MIC and MBC. The cytotoxicity was evaluated
      by the MTT method and neutral red. The production of ROS and nitrogen RNS
      tests were performed in the L929 cell line. Thus, it was possible to
      confirm the production of AgNPs-KP, through morphological, structural and
      elemental analysis. AgNPs from Klebsiella pneumoniae had potent
      antimicrobial activity in low concentration against antimicrobial
      resistant pathogens with MIC 9.76 µg mL(-1) and MBC 9.06 µg mL(-1).
      Moreover, AgNPs-KP in concentrations of 10, 30 and 100 µg mL(-1) did not
      show cytotoxic properties for the L929 fibroblast, where only the
      cytotoxic effect was observed in high concentrations (300 µg mL(-1)).
      AgNPs-KP did not produce ROS about the analyzed concentrations and RNS
      production was only in the highest concentration of 3000 µg mL(-1).
      Therefore, AgNPs biosynthesized by Klebsiella pneumoniae have potential
      medical applicability as a promising antimicrobial agent, using a simple
      and low-cost method, correlating nanomedicine as nanostructured materials.

AB  - Double-carbapenem combinations have shown synergistic potential against
      carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales, but data remain inconclusive.
      This study evaluated the activity of double-carbapenem combinations
      against 51 clinical KPC-2-, OXA-48-, NDM-1, and NDM-5-producing
      Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae and against constructed E. coli
      strains harboring genes encoding KPC-2, OXA-48, or NDM-1 in an otherwise
      isogenic background. Two-drug combinations of ertapenem, meropenem, and
      doripenem were evaluated in 24 h time-lapse microscopy experiments with a
      subsequent spot assay and in static time-kill experiments. An enhanced
      effect in time-lapse microscopy experiments at 24 h and synergy in the
      spot assay was detected with one or more combinations against 4/14 KPC-2-,
      17/17 OXA-48-, 2/17 NDM-, and 1/3 NDM-1+OXA-48-producing clinical
      isolates. Synergy rates were higher against meropenem- and
      doripenem-susceptible isolates and against OXA-48 producers. NDM
      production was associated with significantly lower synergy rates in E.
      coli. In time-kill experiments with constructed KPC-2-, OXA-48- and
      NDM-1-producing E. coli, 24 h synergy was not observed; however, synergy
      at earlier time points was found against the KPC-2- and OXA-48-producing
      constructs. Our findings indicate that the benefit of double-carbapenem
      combinations against carbapenemase-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae is
      limited, especially against isolates that are resistant to the constituent
      antibiotics and produce NDM.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) actively hydrolyzes carbapenems,
      antibiotics often used a last-line treatment for multidrug-resistant
      bacteria. KPC clinical relevance resides in its widespread dissemination.
      In this work, we report the genomic context of KPC coding genes
      bla(KPC-2), bla(KPC-3) and bla(KPC-30) in multidrug-resistant
      Klebsiellapneumoniae isolates from Brazil. Plasmids harboring bla(KPC-3)
      and bla(KPC-30) were identified. Fifteen additional carbapenem-resistant
      K. pneumoniae isolates were selected from the same tertiary hospital,
      collected over a period of 8 years. Their genomes were sequenced in order
      to evaluate the prevalence and dissemination of bla(KPC)-harboring
      plasmids. We found that bla(KPC) genes were mostly carried by one of two
      isoforms of transposon Tn4401 (Tn4401a or Tn4401b) that were predominantly
      located on plasmids highly similar to the previously described plasmid
      pKPC_FCF3SP (IncN). The identified pKPC_FCF3SP-like plasmids carried
      either bla(KPC-2) or bla(KPC-30). Two K. pneumoniae isolates harbored
      pKpQIL-like (IncFII) plasmids, only recently identified in Brazil; one of
      them harbored bla(KPC-3) in a Tn4401a transposon. Underlining the risk of
      horizontal spread of KPC coding genes, this study reports the prevalence
      of bla(KPC-2) and the recent spread of bla(KPC-3,) and bla(KPC-30), in
      association with different isoforms of Tn4401, together with high synteny
      of plasmid backbones among isolates studied here and in comparison with
      previous reports.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Carbapenems are beta-lactam antibiotics that can play an
      important role in infections with multiple and severe resistance. The aim
      of this study was to investigate the frequency of carbapenem-producing
      bacteria in gram-negative isolates of clinical samples obtained from
      patients. METHODS: 291 g-negative bacilli were isolated from the samples
      of hospitalized patients using gram staining method, conventional methods
      and biochemical tests. The antibiotic susceptibility of the isolates was
      determined using the agar disk diffusion method for 5 different
      antibiotics. Strains that were resistant to Meropenem antibiotic, KPC
      enzyme production was examined by the Modified Hodge test method. RESULTS:
      Out of 291 g-negative bacilli, 14 isolates showed resistance to Meropenem
      by a disk agar diffusion method where 12 (85.8%) strains were producing
      KPC enzyme. The highest frequency of Gram-negative KPC-producing bacilli
      was related to Klebsiella pneumoniae and the most positive samples were
      urine. The prevalence of this type of bacteria was highest in NICU and the
      male internal ward, respectively. CONCLUSION: It was shown that
      carbapenem-resistant strains are considered as a growing problem in
      hospitals, especially in the intensive care unit for children and men.

AB  - Reconstruction of complex penile defects is always challenging, as some
      defects are not possible to reconstruct with skin or mucosa grafts, and
      even local flaps may be precluded in complex wounds. We present a case of
      a 63-year-old otherwise healthy man, who underwent transurethral resection
      of the prostate for benign prostatic hyperplasia. After the procedure, he
      developed panurethral necrosis with consequent stricture. Three
      urethroplasties for reconstruction of the bulbar and distal urethra using
      buccal mucosa grafts, a preputial flap, and penile skin were performed by
      urology team in different institutions, but serious urinary fistulization
      and carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC) infection
      translated in a chronic wound, urethra necrosis, and near-total penile
      amputation. A composite anterolateral thigh flap and vascularized fascia
      lata were used with success together with a perineal urethroplasty in
      different stages, improving the ischemic wound condition. The extended
      segment of fascia lata was used for Buck's fascia replacement and
      circumferential reinforcement to cover the erectile bodies of the penis.
      The postoperative period was uneventful and after 12 months, there were no
      signs of recurrence or wound dehiscence. He was able and easily adapted to
      void in a seated position through the perineal urethrostomy that was made.
      To the best of our knowledge, this procedure has not been reported
      previously as a salvage procedure in a fistulizated and KPC infected
      penis, but it may be considered to avoid penile amputation in chronic
      infected and intractable wounds.

AB  - This study aimed at the characterization of carbapenem-resistant
      Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates focusing on typing of the bla(OXA-48-like)
      genes. Additionally, the correlation between the resistance pattern and
      biofilm formation capacity of the carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae
      isolates was studied. The collected isolates were assessed for their
      antimicrobial resistance and carbapenemases production by a modified Hodge
      test and inhibitor-based tests. The carbapenemases encoding genes
      (bla(KPC), bla(NDM), bla(VIM), bla(IMP), and bla(OXA-48-like)) were
      detected by PCR. Isolates harboring bla(OXA-48-like) genes were genotyped
      by Enterobacterial Repetitive Intergenic Consensus-Polymerase Chain
      Reaction (ERIC-PCR) and plasmid profile analysis. The discriminatory power
      of the three typing methods (antibiogram, ERIC-PCR, and plasmid profile
      analysis) was compared by calculation of Simpson's Diversity Index (SDI).
      The transferability of bla(OXA-48) gene was tested by chemical
      transformation. The biofilm formation capacity and the prevalence of the
      genes encoding the fimbrial adhesins (fimH-1 and mrkD) were investigated.
      The isolates showed remarkable resistance to β-lactams and non-β-lactams
      antimicrobials. The coexistence of the investigated carbapenemases
      encoding genes was prevalent except for only 15 isolates. The plasmid
      profile analysis had the highest discriminatory power (SDI = 0.98) in
      comparison with ERIC-PCR (SDI = 0.89) and antibiogram (SDI = 0.78). The
      transferability of bla(OXA-48) gene was unsuccessful. All isolates were
      biofilm formers with the absence of a significant correlation between the
      biofilm formation capacity and resistance profile. The genes fimH-1 and
      mrkD were prevalent among the isolates. The prevalence of carbapenemases
      encoding genes, especially bla(OXA-48-like) genes in Egyptian healthcare
      settings, is worrisome and necessitates further strict dissemination
      control measures.

AB  - The incidence and transmission of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase
      (KPC) producing plasmids have been well documented. However, the
      evolutionary dynamics of KPC plasmids and their fitness costs are not well
      characterized. Here, two carbapenemase-producing plasmids from Proteus
      mirabilis, pT18 and pT211 (both carrying bla (KPC-2)), were characterized
      through whole genome sequencing. pT211 is a 24.2 kbp N-type plasmid that
      contains bla (KPC-2) and a single copy of the IS6-family insertion
      sequence IS26. pT18 is a 59 kbp cointegrate plasmid comprised of sequences
      derived from three different plasmids: a close relative of pT211
      (containing bla (KPC-2)), an FII-33 plasmid (bla (TEM-1B), bla (CTX-M-65),
      rmtB and fosA3) and a rolling-circle plasmid. The segments of pT18 derived
      from each of the different plasmids are separated by copies of IS26, and
      sequence analysis indicated that pT18 was likely generated by both
      conservative and replicative IS26-mediated cointegrate formation. pT18 and
      pT211 were transferred into Escherichia coli DH5α separately to assess the
      impact of plasmids on host fitness. Only DH5α harbouring pT18 grew slower
      than the wild type in antibiotic-free media. However, in sub-inhibitory
      concentrations of fosfomycin and amikacin, cells containing pT18 grew
      faster than the wild type, and the minimum concentrations of fosfomycin
      and amikacin required to observe an advantage for plasmid-carrying cells
      were 1/3 and 1/20 the DH5α MIC, respectively. This study highlights the
      importance of the role of cointegrate plasmids in the dissemination of
      antibiotic resistance genes between pathogenic bacterial species, and
      highlights the importance of sub-inhibitory concentrations of antibiotics
      to the persistence of such plasmids.

AB  - K. pneumoniae (KPN) is one of the widest spread bacteria in which combined
      resistance to several antimicrobial groups is frequent. The most common
      β-lactamases found in K. pneumoniae are class A carbapenemases, both
      chromosomal-encoded (i.e., NMCA, IMI-1) and plasmid-encoded (i.e.,
      GES-enzymes, IMI-2), VIM, IMP, NDM, OXA-48, and extended-spectrum
      β-lactamases (ESBLs) such as CTX-M enzymes. In the present study, a total
      of 68 carbapenem-resistant KPN were collected from twelve long-term care
      facilities (LTCFs) in the Northern Italian region. The whole-genome
      sequencing (WGS) of each KPN strain was determined using a MiSeq Illumina
      sequencing platform and analysed by a bacterial analysis pipeline (BAP)
      tool. The WGS analysis showed the prevalence of ST307, ST512, and ST37 as
      major lineages diffused among the twelve LTCFs. The other lineages found
      were: ST11, ST16, ST35, ST253, ST273, ST321, ST416, ST1519, ST2623, and
      ST3227. The bla(KPC-)(2), bla(KPC-)(3), bla(KPC-)(9), bla(SHV-)(11),
      bla(SHV-)(28), bla(CTX-M-)(15), bla(OXA-)(1), bla(OXA-)(9), bla(OXA-)(23),
      qnrS1, qnrB19, qnrB66, aac(6')-Ib-cr, and fosA were the resistance genes
      widespread in most LTCFs. In this study, we demonstrated the spreading of
      thirteen KPN lineages among the LTCFs. Additionally, KPC carbapenemases
      are the most widespread β-lactamase.

AB  - BACKGROUND: K. pneumoniae is one of the bacteria most frequently causing
      health care-associated urinary tract infections, and increasingly
      incriminating Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase producers (KPCp). Most
      infections caused by KPCp are nosocomial and might cause serious issues,
      even leading to death in half of the reported cases. Our aim was to
      identify the best strategy, based on available scientific data, for the
      use of new antibiotic treatments to manage KPCp UTIs. METHODS: this
      narrative review of the literature was performed according to the criteria
      of preferred reporting items for systematic review and meta-analyses
      statement (PRISMA) (2020). RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: KPCp-UTIs are a real
      challenge for physicians. While cefiderocol, meropenem-vaborbactam,
      ceftazidim-avibactam, and imipenem-relebactam represent a major step
      forward in the treatment of these UTIs, no guidelines are currently
      available, in view of choosing the most appropriate treatment, in each
      specific case.

AB  - Background: Failure in the reprocessing of thermolabile flexible
      endoscopes has been reported as one of the most important threats to
      patient health. Method: A case report and observational study was
      conducted, from August 2014 to December 2019, in the Digestive Endoscopy
      Unit of a University Hospital in Italy, where two cases of Klebsiella
      pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae infections
      in patients undergoing endoscopic retrograde cholangio-pancreatography
      were observed. Following the risk/safety management practices, an
      epidemiological investigation was started, duodenoscopes were removed from
      use and the reprocessing practices reviewed. Moreover, microbiological
      surveillance of endoscopes was carried out according to the CDC
      guidelines. Results: In the first phase of sampling, 10/10 (100%)
      endoscopes were found to be non-compliant, of which 7 showed results for
      high-concern organisms (HCOs), such as KPC-K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa
      and E. coli. After implementing corrective actions, 12 out of 17
      endoscopes were found to be non-compliant (70.5%), of which 8 showed
      results for HCOs, such as KPC-K. oxytoca and P. aeruginosa. During the
      last year of regular microbiological surveillance, only 23% of endoscopes
      (35/152) were found to be non-compliant, of which 7 showed results for
      HCOs, such as NDM-K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. The
      crucial issues were related to samples collected from the internal
      channels of duodenoscopes. Conclusion: Managing the risk associated with
      the reprocessing of digestive endoscopes, through risk assessment at every
      stage of the process, is important for the prevention of infections
      associated with the use of these device.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae -carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae (KPC)
      sequence-type 258 (ST258) has emerged as an important human pathogen
      throughout the world. Although lacking known virulence factors, it is
      associated with significant morbidity and high mortality rates. The
      pathogenicity of KPC K. pneumoniae ST258 strains has not been fully
      elucidated yet. We sought to investigate the interactions of the KPC K.
      pneumoniae ST258-clade I with different components of innate immunity.
      Human serum was used to evaluate the serum bactericidal activity and the
      J774A.1 murine (BALB/c mice) macrophage cell-line was used to examine
      phagocytosis, mRNA expression and production of the pro-inflammatory
      cytokines IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6. L-78, a KPC-producing K. pneumoniae
      ST258-clade I strain was used as representative of the strains circulating
      in Greek hospitals. K. pneumoniae ATCC 43816, a virulent K2 strain, was
      used for comparison. Strain L-78 was susceptible to human serum and
      rapidly phagocytosed by J774A.1 cells, in contrast to the virulent K2
      strain, which was serum-resistant and slowly phagocytosed. Stimulation of
      the J774A.1 cells with the L-78 strain induced production of IL-1β at
      concentration levels significantly higher compared to K2, whereas
      production of TNF-α and IL-6 levels were comparable by the two strains.
      L-78 was able to induce IL-1β mRNA and NLRP3 mRNA expression. Our findings
      indicate that K. pneumoniae ST258-clade I is serum sensitive, rapidly
      phagocytosed and is capable of eliciting adequate innate immune response
      in terms of production of pro-inflammatory cytokines.

AB  - Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) and carbapenemase-producing
      Enterobacterales (CPE) have become global threats. CRE- and CPE- derived
      infections have been associated with high mortality due to limited
      treatment options. Nacubactam is a β-lactamase inhibitor and belongs to
      the new class of diazabicyclooctane. The agent has an in vitro
      antimicrobial activity against several classes of β-lactamase-producing
      Enterobacterales. This study evaluated antimicrobial activity of
      combination therapies including β-lactams (aztreonam, cefepime, and
      meropenem) and nacubactam against four Enterobacter cloacae and six
      Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates with murine pneumonia model. Based on
      changes in bacterial quantity, antimicrobial activities of some regimens
      were assessed. Combination therapies including β-lactams (aztreonam,
      cefepime, and meropenem) with nacubactam showed enhanced antimicrobial
      activity against CRE E. cloacae (-3.70 to -2.08 Δlog(10) CFU/lungs) and K.
      pneumoniae (-4.24 to 1.47 Δlog(10) CFU/lungs) with IMP-1, IMP-6, or KPC
      genes, compared with aztreonam, cefepime, meropenem, and nacubactam
      monotherapies. Most combination therapies showed bacteriostatic (-3.0 to 0
      Δlog(10) CFU/lungs) to bactericidal (<-3.0 Δlog(10) CFU/lungs) activities
      against CRE isolates. This study revealed that combination regimens with
      β-lactams (aztreonam, cefepime, and meropenem) and nacubactam are
      preferable candidates to treat pneumonia due to CRE and CPE.

TI  - Sensitization of KPC and NDM Klebsiella pneumoniae To Rifampicin by the
      Human Lactoferrin-Derived Peptide hLF1-11

AB  - A synergistic effect of non-bactericidal concentrations of the human
      lactoferrin (hLF)-derived peptide hLF1-11 and rifampicin against
      multidrug-resistant KPC (Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase)-producing K.
      pneumoniae has been previously shown. The present study focuses on the
      mechanism(s) underlying this synergistic effect. The contribution of
      hLF1-11 and rifampicin to the synergistic effect was evaluated by killing
      assays with KPC K. pneumoniae cells incubated with hLF1-11 and, after
      washing, with rifampicin, or vice versa. Cell membrane permeability and
      polarization upon exposure to hLF1-11 and/or rifampicin were evaluated by
      ethidium bromide (EtBr) and DiBAC(4)(3) (bis-1,3-dibutylbarbituric acid
      trimethine oxonol) permeability, respectively. The effect of carbonyl
      cyanide m-chlorophenyl hydrazone (CCCP), an uncoupler of oxidative
      phosphorylation, was also evaluated. KPC K. pneumoniae cells were
      effectively killed after prior exposure to rifampicin for 30 to 60 min
      followed by treatment with hLF1-11, while no antibacterial activity was
      observed when cells were incubated with hLF1-11 first and then with
      rifampicin. EtBr accumulation increased upon exposure to hLF1-11 or the
      combination of hLF1-11 and rifampicin, but not upon exposure to rifampicin
      alone. Moreover, hLF1-11 induced a dose-dependent membrane depolarization.
      As expected, the antibacterial activity of hLF1-11 alone or combined with
      rifampicin was significantly reduced in the presence of CCCP. Furthermore,
      hLF1-11 and rifampicin were synergistic also against a colistin-resistant
      NDM (New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase)-producing K. pneumoniae strain. The
      results suggest that rifampicin was accumulated by KPC cells during the
      30-to-60-min incubation and that the addition of hLF1-11 sensitized
      bacterial cells to rifampicin by inducing a transient loss of membrane
      potential and increased cell membrane permeability, thus facilitating the
      entrance and retention of rifampicin into the cytoplasm. IMPORTANCE The
      present study describes a synergistic effect between rifampicin, an
      impermeable hydrophobic antibiotic with an intracellular target, and an
      hLF1-11, an antimicrobial peptide derived from human lactoferrin, against
      multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae. Carbapenem-resistant K.
      pneumoniae has recently caused an outbreak in Tuscany, Italy, thus
      pressing the need for the development of new treatment options. The
      mechanisms underlying such a synergistic effect have been studied. The
      results suggest that the synergistic effect was due to the transient loss
      of membrane potential induced by hLF1-11 and the subsequent increase in
      cell membrane permeability which allowed rifampicin to enter the bacterial
      cell. Therefore, it is likely that a sub-inhibitory concentration of
      hLF1-11 can efficiently permeabilize K. pneumoniae cells to rifampicin,
      allowing the antibiotic to reach its intracellular target. These results
      encourage further exploration of possible applications of this synergistic
      combination in the treatment of K. pneumoniae infections.

AB  - New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM) carbapenemase has been considered a
      global threat due to its worldwide widespread in recent years. In
      Portugal, a very low number of infections with NDM-producing
      Enterobacterales has been reported. A total of 52 strains from 40 patients
      and 1 environmental sample isolated during COVID-19 pandemic were included
      in this study. Wholegenome sequencing (WGS) was performed on 20
      carbapenemase-producing strains, including 17 NDM-1-producing Klebsiella
      pneumoniae ST11-KL105 lineage strains, one NDM-1-producing Escherichia
      coli ST58 strain and one KPC-3-producing K. pneumoniae ST147 strain,
      recovered from a total of 19 patients. Of interest, also one
      NDM-1-producing K. pneumoniae ST11-KL105 was collected from the hospital
      environment. Genome-wide phylogenetic analysis revealed an ongoing
      dissemination of NDM-1-producing K. pneumoniae ST11 strains (n = 18) with
      the same genetic features seen across multiple wards. Furthermore, the
      ST58 E. coli strain, collected from a patient rectal swab that was also
      colonised with a K. pneumoniae strain, also showed the IncFIA plasmid
      replicon and the bla(NDM-1) gene (preceded by IS30 and followed by genes
      ble(MBL), trpF, dsbC, cutA, groES and groEL). The bla(NDM-1) is part of
      Tn125-like identical to those reported in Poland, Italy and India. The
      bla(KPC-3) K. pneumoniae ST147-KL64 strain has the genetic environment
      Tn4401d isoform. In conclusion, herein we report the molecular
      epidemiology, resistome, virulome and mobilome of the first NDM-1
      carbapenemase outbreak caused by K. pneumoniae ST11-KL105 lineage during
      the COVID-19 pandemic in Portugal. Moreover, the outbreak strains
      characterised included seventeen different patients (infected and
      colonised) and one environmental sample which also emphasises the role of
      commensal and hospital environment strains in the dissemination of the
      outbreak.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Enterobacteriaceae
      have become widespread in hospitals and the environment. Here, we describe
      a bla(KPC-2)-carrying plasmid called pCRE3-KPC, which was recovered from a
      clinical multidrug-resistant Citrobacter braakii CRE3 strain in China. The
      complete nucleotide sequence of pCRE3-KPC was determined by combining
      MiSeq and MinION sequencing and then compared with those of three related
      plasmids. Plasmid conjugal transfer and electroporation tests, modified
      carbapenem inactivation method, and bacterial antimicrobial susceptibility
      test were carried out. We compared this plasmid with three related
      plasmids to verify that the backbone of pCRE3-KPC was composed of the
      backbones of the IncR plasmid and IncP6 plasmid. Further bioinformatics
      analysis showed that pCRE3-KPC carried two resistance-related regions (the
      bla(KPC-2) gene cluster and the aacC2-tmrB-related region). The
      aacC2-tmrB-related region included two novel insertion sequences (ISCfr28
      and ISCfr16).IMPORTANCE Reports of human-pathogenic C. braakii strains,
      especially of strains showing resistance to carbapenems, are rare. To the
      best of our knowledge, our results represent the first detection of
      carbapenemase gene bla(KPC-2) in C. braakii strains. In addition, we have
      studied detailed genetic characteristics of the novel IncR/IncP6 hybrid
      plasmid pCRE3-KPC, which was isolated from a clinical multidrug-resistant
      Citrobacter braakii CRE3 strain. Our results may provide further insight
      into the horizontal transfer of multidrug resistance genes in bacteria and
      into the genomic diversity and molecular evolution of plasmids.

AB  - Combating plasmid-mediated carbapenem resistance is essential to control
      and prevent the dissemination of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae
      (CRE). Here, we conducted a proof-of-concept study to demonstrate that
      CRISPR-Cas9-mediated resistance gene and plasmid curing can effectively
      resensitize CRE to carbapenems. A novel CRISPR-Cas9-mediated
      plasmid-curing system (pCasCure) was developed and electrotransferred into
      various clinical CRE isolates. The results showed that pCasCure can
      effectively cure bla(KPC), bla(NDM), and bla(OXA-48) in various
      Enterobacteriaceae species of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli,
      Enterobacter hormaechei, Enterobacter xiangfangensis, and Serratia
      marcescens clinical isolates, with a >94% curing efficiency. In addition,
      we also demonstrated that pCasCure can efficiently eliminate several
      epidemic carbapenem-resistant plasmids, including the bla(KPC)-harboring
      IncFIIK-pKpQIL and IncN pKp58_N plasmids, the bla(OXA-48)-harboring
      pOXA-48-like plasmid, and the bla(NDM)-harboring IncX3 plasmid, by
      targeting their replication and partitioning (parA in pKpQIL) genes.
      However, curing the bla(OXA-48) gene failed to eliminate its corresponding
      pOXA-48-like plasmid in clinical K. pneumoniae isolate 49210, while
      further next-generation sequencing revealed that it was due to
      IS1R-mediated recombination outside the CRISPR-Cas9 cleavage site
      resulting in bla(OXA-48) truncation and, therefore, escaped plasmid
      curing. Nevertheless, the curing of carbapenemase genes or plasmids,
      including the truncation of bla(OXA-48) in 49210, successfully restore
      their susceptibility to carbapenems, with a >8-fold reduction of MIC
      values in all tested isolates. Taken together, our study confirmed the
      concept of using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated carbapenemase gene and plasmid
      curing to resensitize CRE to carbapenems. Further work is needed to
      integrate pCasCure in an optimal delivery system to make it applicable for
      clinical intervention.

AB  - Ceftazidime-avibactam (CAV) is a new treatment option against
      carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) infections. However, the
      rapid emergence of CAV resistance mediated by KPC variants has posed a
      severe threat to healthcare after its clinical application. The
      characteristics of CAV resistance in CRKP strains needs to be determined
      in China. A total of 477 CRKP isolates were collected from 46 hospitals in
      Zhejiang Province from 2018 to 2021. The results demonstrated that CAV had
      a potent activity against 94.5% of all CRKP (451/477, 95% CI: 93.0-96.1%)
      and 86.0% of CRKP strains carrying bla(KPC) genes (410/477, 95% CI:
      83.5-88.4%). A total of 26 CAV-resistant strains were found. Among these
      strains, sixteen harbored metallo-β lactamases, and two carried KPC-2
      carbapenemase and mutated ompK35 and ompK36. Eight CRKP strains encoded
      KPC-33 or KPC-93, belonging to ST11, among which seven strains were
      detected in patients hospitalized in 2021 after exposure to CAV and one
      strain was associated with intra-hospital spread. CAV is a potent agent in
      vitro against CRKP strains. The rapid development of CAV resistance
      mediated by various KPC variants after a short period of CAV treatment has
      increased and brought difficulties in treating infections caused by CRKP
      strains, especially those belonging to ST11. The surveillance of bacterial
      resistance against CAV is highly recommended due to the steep development
      of CAV resistance and rapid evolution of KPC enzymes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) is an
      important pathogen causing hospital-associated outbreaks worldwide. The
      spread of K. pneumoniae carbapenemase-2 (KPC-2)-producing CRKP is
      primarily associated with sequence type (ST) 11. METHODS: A total of 152
      KPC-2-producing K. pneumoniae ST11 isolates were collected from the
      respiratory department of a tertiary care hospital in Beijing, China
      between 2009 and 2018. The genome sequencing of these isolates was
      performed on the HiSeq X Ten sequencer. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST),
      capsular type, plasmid replicon types and resistance genes were
      identified. Fifteen isolates were selected for the subsequent
      single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing on the PacBio RS II. Alignment
      of the complete sequences of the plasmids carrying bla (KPC-2) and/or
      virulence genes was performed by using BRIG and Easyfig. RESULTS: From
      2012 to 2018, the detection rate of the bla (KPC-2)-carrying CRKP rose
      rapidly from 3.3 to 28.1%. KPC-2-producing K. pneumoniae ST11 isolates
      were dominant in CRKP, which emerged in 2012 and caused several outbreaks.
      Most isolates exhibited multidrug-resistant to commonly used antibiotics,
      while all the isolates remained susceptible to tigecycline and polymyxin
      B. The single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis showed that all these
      152 KPC-2-producing K. pneumoniae ST11 isolates could be divided into
      three genetically distinct clades (A, B, and C) and eleven subclades
      (A1-A9 and B1-B2). The majority belonged to clade A with KL47 serotype (n
      = 117, 77.0%), while KL64 and KL16 were identified in clades B and C,
      respectively. The bla (KPC-2)-carrying plasmids exhibited diverse types,
      namely, IncFII (pHN7A8)/IncR(6/15), IncFII (pHN7A8)/Inc(pA1763-KPC)
      (5/15), IncFII (pHN7A8) (1/15), IncR (1/15), and Inc(pA1763-KPC) (1/15).
      The genetic environment of bla (KPC-2) showed nine IS26-based composite
      transposons, which had a basic core structure ISKpn27-bla (KPC-2)-ΔISKpn6.
      About 27.6% (42/152) isolates co-carried 2 to 4 virulence marker genes
      (namely, peg344, iucA, iroB, rmpA, and rmpA2) for hvKp strains. At least
      three isolates were identified to harbor virulence gene-carrying plasmids.
      CONCLUSION: KPC-2-producing K. pneumoniae ST11 was highly heterogeneous in
      our hospital. Transmission of these strains was mainly mediated by twelve
      high-risk clones. The bla (KPC-2)-carrying plasmids and genetic
      environment of bla (KPC-2) genes exhibited active evolution in K.
      pneumoniae ST11. More attention should be paid to the tendency of
      KPC-2-ST11 to acquire hypervirulent plasmids.

AB  - Background: Bloodstream infections (BSIs) are recognized as important
      nosocomial infections. Klebsiella pneumoniae is one of the major causes of
      bacteremia. This retrospective study focused on drug susceptibility and
      molecular epidemiology of K. pneumoniae isolated from intensive care unit
      (ICU) patients with BSI in Shanghai, China. Methods: Consecutive K.
      pneumoniae isolates were collected from ICU patients. Antibiotic
      susceptibility testing was conducted by the broth microdilution method.
      PCR was performed to detect antimicrobial resistance genes. We also
      completed multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and GoeBURST was used to
      analyze the result of MLST. Results: A total of 78 K. pneumoniae isolates
      were enrolled. K. pneumoniae from ICU-BSIs were highly resistant to almost
      all common antibiotics. The most frequent resistance determinants
      responsible for extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) producers were bla
      (CTX-M-14), bla (CTX-M-15), and bla (CTX-M-55). KPC was the only enzyme,
      which was detected by the carbapenemase producers. The most principal
      sequence types (STs) were ST11, ST15, and ST23. Conclusion: This study
      presents for the first time the antibiotic resistance phenotype and
      molecular epidemiology of K. pneumoniae isolated from ICU patients with
      BSIs in Shanghai. ICU-BSI K. pneumoniae is characteristic of a high
      resistance rate. The occurrence of the KPC-2 enzyme may result from
      nosocomial clonal dissemination of ST11 K. pneumoniae.

AB  - Background: Recent scientific reports on the use of high dose tigecycline
      monotherapy as a "drug of last resort" warrant further research into the
      use of this regimen for the treatment of severe multidrug-resistant,
      Gram-negative bacterial infections. In the current study, the therapeutic
      efficacy of tigecycline monotherapy was investigated and compared to
      meropenem monotherapy in a newly developed rat model of fatal lobar
      pneumonia-septicemia. Methods: A Klebsiella pneumoniae producing
      extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) and an isogenic variant producing K.
      pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) were used in the study. Both strains were
      tested for their in vitro antibiotic susceptibility and used to induce
      pneumonia-septicemia in rats, which was characterized using disease
      progression parameters. Therapy with tigecycline or meropenem was
      initiated at the moment that rats suffered from progressive infection and
      was administered 12-hourly over 10 days. The pharmacokinetics of meropenem
      were determined in infected rats. Results: In rats with ESBL
      pneumonia-septicemia, the minimum dosage of meropenem achieving survival
      of all rats was 25 mg/kg/day. However, in rats with KPC
      pneumonia-septicemia, this meropenem dosage was unsuccessful. In contrast,
      all rats with KPC pneumonia-septicemia were successfully cured by
      administration of high-dose tigecycline monotherapy of 25 mg/kg/day (i.e.,
      the minimum tigecycline dosage achieving 100% survival of rats with ESBL
      pneumonia-septicemia in a previous study). Conclusions: The current study
      supports recent literature recommending high-dose tigecycline as a last
      resort regimen for the treatment of severe multidrug-resistant bacterial
      infections. The use of ESBL- and KPC-producing K. pneumoniae strains in
      the current rat model of pneumonia-septicemia enables further
      investigation, helping provide supporting data for follow-up clinical
      trials in patients suffering from severe multidrug-resistant bacterial
      respiratory infections.

AB  - BACKGROUND: ST11 is the most prevalent sequence type of clinical
      Klebsiella pneumoniae in China. METHODS: We investigated the
      characteristics of the ST11 subclones using core genome multi-locus
      sequence typing (cgMLST). Ninety-three carbapenemase-producing K.
      pneumoniae isolates were collected at Shenzhen People's Hospital. Then,
      whole-genome sequencing and cgMLST were used to discriminate apparent
      subclones within the ST11 group. RESULTS: We analyzed the prevalence and
      genetic relationships of these subclones. ST11 and K. pneumoniae
      carbapenemase (KPC-2) were the predominant genotype and carbapenemase,
      respectively, in the clinical carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae
      strains. cgMLST scheme genotyping divided the ST11 group into two clades
      across seven complex types (CTs). CT1313 was the most prevalent subclone.
      The deletion of galF and a high frequency of SNPs in genes associated with
      the stress- and SOS-responses were found in CT1291 and CT2405 over time,
      respectively. CONCLUSION: Our results indicated that the subclones of the
      ST11 group had different patterns of prevalence. Highly discriminatory
      genotyping techniques, such as cgMLST scheme, should be used in further
      molecular epidemiology investigations.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Tigecycline is one of the last resorts for
      carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP) infections. Indeed,
      tigecycline-non-susceptible K. pneumoniae (TNSKP) strains are increasingly
      treated with the use of tigecycline. In this study, we attempted to better
      understand their epidemiological trends and characteristics. K. pneumoniae
      were collected from 2017 to 2020 at the First Affiliated Hospital of
      Nanchang University. METHODS: Thirty-four TNSKP strains were selected
      during the study period, all of which were analyzed using antimicrobial
      susceptibility testing, multilocus sequence typing (MLST), and
      pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). PCR and DNA sequencing were
      performed for the detection of β-lactamase genes and carbapenemase genes,
      and the mutation analysis of tet(A), tet(X), tet(L), tet(M), rpsJ, ramR,
      and oqxR, which are related to tigecycline resistance. Virulence gene and
      capsular genotype testing were conducted to identify whether the TNSKP
      strains were hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae. RESULTS: An epidemiology
      analysis showed that Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-2 (KPC-2) was the
      predominant carbapenemase in tigecycline non-susceptible
      carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (TNSCRKP) (96.7%), and the dominant
      clone type was ST11-K14K64 (82.4%). Among them, 55.9% (19/34) of strains
      were from each department of ICU, particularly EICU and neurosurgery ICU.
      In order to further understand the molecular mechanisms of the TNSKP, a
      polymerase chain reaction of the resistant determinants was carried out.
      The results detected many tigecycline-resistant genes, such as tet(A)
      (97.1%), tet(X) (17.6%), rpsJ (97.1%), and ramR (8.8%). CONCLUSION: As the
      results of this study reveal, we should take effective measures to control
      the increase in TNSKP.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) among Gram-negative
      bacteria, predominantly Escherichia coli (E. coli), in Nepal, have been
      rising. The main objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence
      of uropathogenic E. coli, antibiotic resistance, ESBLs, ABLs (AmpC type
      β-lactamases), MBLs (metallo-β-lactamases) and KPCs (Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenemases) and their correlation with plasmid profiling patterns
      among patients with urinary tract infections in a tertiary hospital in
      Kathmandu, Nepal. METHODS: The mid-stream urine samples collected from
      patients were inoculated in cystine-lactose-electrolyte-deficient (CLED)
      agar plates. E. coli producing ESBLs, ABLs, MBLs/KPC were identified
      phenotypically using standard microbiological methods. Plasmids were
      extracted by alkaline lysis method from E. coli isolates and profiled
      using agarose gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: Out of the total 2661 urine
      samples, E. coli were isolated in 64.34% (507/788), among which 170
      (33.53%) were multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates. All MDR isolates were
      resistant to amoxicillin and third-generation cephalosporins but were
      highly sensitive to imipenem (94.12%, 160/170), amikacin (92.94%, 158/170)
      and nitrofurantoin (86.47%, 147/170). Among 170 MDR isolates, 78.2%
      (133/170) were ESBLs, 46.3% (50/170) were AmpC, 11.2% (19/170) were MBL
      and 0.6% (1/170) were KPC producers. Coproduction of β-lactamases was
      detected in 24.12% (41/170) of isolates. E. coli isolates showed one
      plasmid (>33.5 kb), which was present in all the isolates. Overall, 44
      different plasmid profile groups were identified based on molecular weight
      and number of plasmids. β-Lactamase producers were relatively resistant to
      the higher number of antibiotics tested (≤10) than non-producers (≤8), and
      the number of plasmids were higher in β-lactamase producers (≤7) than
      those in non-producers (≤5). CONCLUSION: The higher prevalence of the
      ESBLs, AmpCs, KPCs and MBLs along with their coproduction in E. coli
      isolates highlights the importance of routine surveillance of ESBLs,
      AmpCs, KPCs and MBLs in microbiology laboratories using various phenotypic
      methods.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and carbapenemase
      (KPC(+)) producing Klebsiella pneumoniae are multidrug-resistant bacteria
      (MDR) with the highest risk to human health. The significant reduction of
      new antibiotics development can be overcome by complementing with
      alternative therapies, such as antimicrobial photodynamic therapy (aPDI).
      Through photosensitizer (PS) compounds, aPDI produces local oxidative
      stress-activated by light (photooxidative stress), nonspecifically killing
      bacteria. METHODOLOGY: Bimetallic Re(I)-based compounds, PSRe-µL1 and
      PSRe-µL2, were tested in aPDI and compared with a Ru(II)-based PS positive
      control. The ability of PSRe-µL1 and PSRe-µL2 to inhibit K. pneumoniae was
      evaluated under a photon flux of 17 µW/cm(2). In addition, an improved
      aPDI effect with imipenem on KPC(+) bacteria and a synergistic effect with
      cefotaxime on ESBL producers of a collection of 118 clinical isolates of
      K. pneumoniae was determined. Furthermore, trypan blue exclusion assays
      determined the PS cytotoxicity on mammalian cells. RESULTS: At a minimum
      dose of 4 µg/mL, both the PSRe-µL1 and PSRe-µL2 significantly inhibited in
      3log(10) (>99.9%) the bacterial growth and showed a lethality of 60 and 30
      min of light exposure, respectively. Furthermore, they were active on
      clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae at 3-6 log(10). Additionally, a
      remarkably increased effectiveness of aPDI was observed over KPC(+)
      bacteria when mixed with imipenem, and a synergistic effect from 3 to
      6log(10) over ESBL producers of K. pneumoniae clinic isolates when mixed
      with cefotaxime was determined for both PSs. Furthermore, the compounds
      show no dark toxicity and low light-dependent toxicity in vitro to
      mammalian HEp-2 and HEK293 cells. CONCLUSION: Compounds PSRe-µL1 and
      PSRe-µL2 produce an effective and synergistic aPDI effect on KPC(+), ESBL,
      and clinical isolates of K. pneumoniae and have low cytotoxicity in
      mammalian cells.

AB  - Mining of plant-derived antimicrobials is the major focus at current to
      counter antibiotic resistance. This study was conducted to characterize
      the antimicrobial activity and mode of action of linalyl anthranilate
      (LNA) against carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-KP). LNA
      alone exhibited bactericidal activity at 2.5% (V/V), and in combination
      with meropenem (MPM) at 1.25% (V/V). Comparative proteomic analysis showed
      a significant reduction in the number of cytoplasmic and membrane
      proteins, indicating membrane damage in LNA-treated KPC-KP cells.
      Up-regulation of oxidative stress regulator proteins and down-regulation
      of oxidative stress-sensitive proteins indicated oxidative stress. Zeta
      potential measurement and outer membrane permeability assay revealed that
      LNA increases both bacterial surface charge and membrane permeability.
      Ethidium bromide influx/efflux assay showed increased uptake of ethidium
      bromide in LNA-treated cells, inferring membrane damage. Furthermore,
      intracellular leakage of nucleic acid and proteins was detected upon LNA
      treatment. Scanning and transmission electron microscopies again revealed
      the breakage of bacterial membrane and loss of intracellular materials.
      LNA was found to induce oxidative stress by generating reactive oxygen
      species (ROS) that initiate lipid peroxidation and damage the bacterial
      membrane. In conclusion, LNA generates ROS, initiates lipid peroxidation,
      and damages the bacterial membrane, resulting in intracellular leakage and
      eventually killing the KPC-KP cells.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) is disseminated
      worldwide mostly by plasmids. However, in Pseudomonas aeruginosa
      chromosomal mutations are more frequently responsible for resistance to
      carbapenems than the acquisition of mobile elements harbouring
      carbapenemases genes. Indeed, although uncommon, KPC-2-producing P.
      aeruginosa has appeared more frequently, including in Brazil. Here we
      report the first genomic analysis of a plasmid-mediated KPC-2 in an
      extensively drug-resistant (XDR) P. aeruginosa isolated in Santa Catarina,
      Brazil. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed
      according to CLSI 2020 guidelines. The genome was sequenced using an
      Illumina MiSeq platform and the data were analysed using SPAdes and
      Prokka. In silico predictions were fulfilled using curated bioinformatics
      tools. RESULTS: Pseudomonas aeruginosa strain MIMA_PA2.1 (JACGTM000000000)
      was classified as XDR, belongs to sequence type 312 (ST312) and harbours
      the bla(KPC-2) gene located on a small (7975 bp) IncU plasmid. This
      plasmid showed 86.3% identity with a non-conjugative plasmid (KC609322)
      carrying the bla(KPC-2) gene from a multidrug-resistant P. aeruginosa
      (ST1006) from Colombia isolated in 2006. Besides the bla(KPC-2) gene,
      other resistance genes to β-lactams, aminoglycosides, phenicol, fosfomycin
      and quinolones were detected, the last two also associated with mobile
      genetic elements other than the IncU plasmid described here. CONCLUSION:
      This is the first genomic report of the presence of the bla(KPC-2) gene
      carried by Pseudomonas in Southern Brazil and highlights the adaptability
      of bla(KPC-2) to different mobile elements. This draft genome might be
      useful for comparative genomic analyses to monitor the spread of
      plasmid-mediated bla(KPC) in P. aeruginosa in Latin America.

      Escherichia coli ST131 was isolated from a patient admitted to the
      Vascular Surgery Unit of the main hospital of Molise region, Central
      Italy. Sequencing and alignment with the available sequences revealed that
      the isolate harbored the KPC-2 variant and TEM-1 beta-lactamase. This
      observation raises great concerns about the spread of carbapenem
      resistance in national and local settings with high endemicity level of
      KPC in K. pneumoniae, and underlines the importance of strengthening a
      proactive surveillance.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: In total, 97 carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) were
      collected from 17 hospitals located in Nanjing, Southeast China, and
      analyzed for epidemiological characteristics. METHODS: Antimicrobial
      susceptibility was determined; followed by determination of the prevalence
      of resistance determinants, including extended-spectrum β-lactamase
      (ESBLs), plasmid-mediated AmpC enzyme (pAmpCs), plasmid-mediated quinolone
      resistance genes (PMQRs), fosfomycin resistance gene and exogenously
      acquired 16S rRNA methyltransferase (16S-RMTase) using PCR and DNA
      sequencing. The sequence types (STs) of CRE were determined by multi-locus
      sequence typing (MLST). The plasmid profiles were detected by PCR-based
      replicon typing (PBRT). RESULTS: All the CRE strains displayed high
      MIC(50) and MIC(90) for nearly all clinical available antibiotics, except
      for aztreonam/avibactam, minocycline, ceftazidime/avibactam, tigecycline,
      and colistin. KPC-2 (79.4%) and NDM (19.6%) were the main carbapenemases,
      CTX-M (76.3%) and SHV (60.8%) were the predominant ESBLs. In addition,
      oqxAB (70.1%) and qnr (63.9%) were the major PMQRs; rmtB (47.4%) was the
      main 16S-RMTase; fosA (76.3%) and fosA3 (37.1%) were the fosfomycin
      resistance gene. PBRT analysis showed presence of IncR (66.0%) and IncFII
      (64.9%) replicon types in the majority of the isolates, followed by IncFIB
      (46.4%) and IncX3 (16.5%). The IncFII and IncR replicon-types were found
      mainly in K. pneumoniae (68.8%), whereas the IncX3 replicons dominated in
      E. coli isolates (100.0%). The three dominating MLST-types ST11, ST15 and
      ST268 comprised 68.0% of the 77 K. pneumoniae. Seven distinct STs were
      identified among 8 E. coli. CONCLUSIONS: The treatment for infections
      caused by CRE isolates is challenged by the presence of multiple
      resistance determinants and plasmid replicons. Our results highlighted the
      expansion of blaKPC-2 carrying K. pneumoniae ST11, the new emergency of
      single blaNDM-5 carrying K. oxytoca ST36, as well as blaIMP-4 and blaNDM-1
      co-carrying E. cloacae ST418, which alert us on the urgency for
      antimicrobial resistant surveillance, to prevent dissemination of these
      highly transmissible and dangerous lineages.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) is a major
      concern leading to morbidity and mortality in the world. CRE often is
      becoming a cause of therapeutic failure in both hospital and
      community-acquired infections. AIM: This study aimed to investigate the
      resistance mechanisms of CRE by phenotypic and molecular methods.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty CRE (50 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 6 Escherichia
      coli, and 4 Enterobacter spp.) were isolated from October 2018 to June
      2019. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was carried out using
      phenotypic methods. The carbapenem resistance mechanisms including efflux
      pump hyperexpression, AmpC overproduction, carbapenemase genes, and
      deficiency in OmpK35 and OmpK36 were determined by phenotypic and
      molecular methods, respectively. RESULTS: Sixty CRE (50 Klebsiella
      pneumoniae, 6 Escherichia coli, and 4 Enterobacter spp.) were isolated
      from October 2018 to June 2019. Amikacin was found to be the most
      effective drug against CRE isolates. All isolates were resistant to
      imipenem and meropenem by the micro-broth dilution. AmpC overproduction
      was observed in all Enterobacter spp. and three K. pneumoniae isolates. No
      efflux pump activity was found. Carba NP test and Modified Hodge Test
      could find carbapenemase in 59 (98%) isolates and 57 (95%) isolates,
      respectively. The most common carbapenemase gene was bla (OXA-48-like)
      (72.8%) followed by bla (NDM) (50.8%), bla (IMP) (18.6%), bla (VIM)
      (11.8%), and bla (KPC) (6.7%). The ompK35 and ompK36 genes were not
      detected in 10 and 7 K. pneumoniae isolates, respectively. CONCLUSION: The
      amikacin is considered as a very efficient antibiotic for the treatment of
      CRE isolates in our region. Carbapenemase production and overproduction of
      AmpC are the main carbapenem resistance mechanisms in CRE isolates.
      Finally, Carba NP test is a rapid and reliable test for early detection of
      carbapenemase-producing isolates.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the fact that carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales
      (CRE) mostly cause urinary tract infections (UTIs), only few studies have
      focused on the efficacity of mecillinam against these CRE. OBJECTIVES: To
      evaluate the mecillinam susceptibility of a huge collection of CRE,
      including carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) and non-CPE (ESBL
      and AmpC producers with decreased permeability of the outer membrane).
      METHODS: A total of 8310 non-duplicate clinical CRE, including 4042
      OXA-48-like producers, 1094 NDM producers, 411 VIM producers, 174 KPC
      producers, 42 IMI producers, 153 multiple-carbapenemase producers and 45
      isolates producing other types of carbapenemases (such as IMP-like enzymes
      or GES-5), were included in the study. WGS was performed on all CPE using
      Illumina technology. Categorization of susceptibility to mecillinam was
      performed using disc diffusion (mecillinam discs at 10 μg; I2A, France)
      according to EUCAST recommendations. The results were interpreted
      according to EUCAST guidelines (S ≥15 mm). RESULTS: Significantly higher
      susceptibility rates were observed for carbapenem-resistant Proteus spp.
      (85%) and carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli (84%), which are the two
      most common species responsible for UTIs, than for Klebsiella pneumoniae
      (67%), Enterobacter cloacae complex (75%), Citrobacter spp. (65%),
      Serratia spp. (34%) and Morganella morganii (12%). Susceptibility rates
      were 84%, 71% and 91% for OXA-48-like, NDM and IMI producers and 70% for
      non-CPE CRE. Mecillinam was less active against VIM and KPC producers (14%
      and 0%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Mecillinam might be an alternative for
      the treatment of infections due to CRE, particularly UTIs, except for VIM
      and KPC producers and for M. morganii and Serratia spp species.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (CP-Kp) is a
      major cause of infections in transplanted patients and has been associated
      with high mortality rates in this group. There is a lack of information
      about the Brazilian structure population of CP-Kp isolated from
      transplanted patients. By whole-genome sequencing (WGS), we analyzed
      phylogeny, resistome, virulome of CP-Kp isolates, and the structure of
      plasmids encoding bla (KPC-) (2) and bla (NDM-) (1) genes. METHODS: One K.
      pneumoniae isolated from each selected transplanted patient colonized or
      infected by CP-Kp over a 16-month period in a hospital complex in Porto
      Alegre (Brazil) was submitted for WGS. The total number of strains
      sequenced was 80. The hospital complex in Porto Alegre comprised seven
      different hospitals. High-resolution SNP typing, core genome multilocus
      sequence typing (cgMLST), resistance and virulence genes inference, and
      plasmid reconstruction were performed in 80 CP-Kp. RESULTS: The mortality
      rate of CP-Kp colonized or infected transplanted inpatients was 21.3%
      (17/80). Four CP-Kp epidemic clones were described: ST11/KPC-2,
      ST16/KPC-2, and ST15/NDM-1, all responsible for interhospital outbreaks;
      and ST437/KPC-2 affecting a single hospital. The average number of
      acquired resistance and virulence genes was 9 (range = 2-14) and 27 (range
      = 6-36), respectively. Two plasmids carrying the bla (KPC) (-) (2) were
      constructed and belonged to IncN and IncM types. Additionally, an IncFIB
      plasmid carrying the bla (NDM-) (1) was described. CONCLUSION: We detected
      intrahospital and interhospital spread of mobile structures and
      international K. pneumoniae clones as ST11, ST16, and ST15 among
      transplanted patients, which carry a significant range of acquired
      resistance and virulence genes and keep spreading across the world.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: infections due to carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales
      (CRE) constitute a worldwide threat and are associated with significant
      mortality, especially in fragile patients, and costs.
      Meropenem-vaborbactam (M/V) is a combination of a group 2 carbapenem with
      a novel cyclic boronic acid-based β-lactamase inhibitor which has shown
      good efficacy against KPC carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae,
      which are amongst the most prevalent types of CRE. AREAS COVERED: This
      article reviews the microbiological and pharmacological profile and
      current clinical experience and safety of M/V in the treatment of
      infections caused by CRE. EXPERT OPINION: M/V is a promising drug for the
      treatment of infections due to KPC-producing CRE (KPC-CRE). It exhibited
      an almost complete coverage of KPC-CRE isolates from large surveillance
      studies and a low propensity for resistance selection, retaining activity
      also against strains producing KPC mutants resistant to
      ceftazidime-avibactam. Both meropenem and vaborbactam have a favorable
      pharmacokinetic profile, with similar kinetic properties, a good
      intrapulmonary penetration, and are efficiently cleared during continuous
      venovenous hemofiltration (CVVH). According to available data, M/V
      monotherapy is associated with higher clinical cure rates and lower rates
      of adverse events, especially in terms of nephrotoxicity, if compared to
      'older' combination therapies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Multidrug-resistant organisms are an increasing concern in
      patients with decompensated cirrhosis. AIM: We aimed to evaluate the
      prevalence of infections with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in
      patients with decompensated cirrhosis. METHODS: Patients with
      decompensated cirrhosis admitted to ICU were included. The isolated
      Enterobacteriaceae strains were tested for carbapenemase-producing genes
      using the Roche LightMix® Modular VIM/IMP/NDM/GES/KPC/OXA48-carbapenemase
      detection kit. RESULTS: 48 culture-positive infections were registered in
      75 patients with acutely decompensated cirrhosis. Thirty patients
      contracted a second infection. 46% of bacteria isolated at admission and
      60% of bacteria responsible for infections identified during ICU-stay were
      multiresistant. ESBL+ Enterobacteriaceae were predominant at admission,
      while carbapenem-resistance was dominant in both Enterobacteriaceae and
      Non-Fermenting-Gram-Negative Bacteria responsible for infections diagnosed
      during hospitalisation. OXA 48 or KPC type carbapenemases were present in
      30% of the analyzed Enterobacteriaceae and in 40% of the phenotypically
      carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae strains. The length of ICU stay
      was a risk-factor for a second infection (p=0.04). Previous carbapenem
      usage was associated with occurence of infections with
      carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacteria during hospitalization
      (p=0.03). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of infections with
      carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae is high in patients with
      decompensated cirrhosis admitted to ICU. Carbapenemase-producing genes in
      Enterobacteriaceae in our center are bla(OXA-48) and bla(KPC).

AB  - The aim of this study was to characterize the 16S rRNA methylase (RMT)
      genes in aminoglycoside-resistant Enterobacterales and Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa isolates in 2015-2016 in hospitals in Athens, Greece.
      Single-patient, Gram-negative clinical isolates resistant to both amikacin
      and gentamicin (n = 292) were consecutively collected during a two-year
      period (2015-2016) in five tertiary care hospitals in Athens. RMT genes
      were detected by PCR. In all RMT-producing isolates, ESBL and
      carbapenemase production was confirmed by PCR, and the clonal relatedness
      and the plasmid contents were also characterized. None of the 138 P.
      aeruginosa isolates harbored any of the RMT genes surveyed although some
      were highly resistant to aminoglycosides (MICs > = 512 mg/L). Among 154
      Enterobacterales, 31 Providencia stuartii (93.9%), 42 Klebsiella
      pneumoniae (37.8%), six Proteus mirabilis (75%), and two Escherichia coli
      (100%) isolates were confirmed as highly resistant to amikacin,
      gentamicin, and tobramycin with MICs ≥ 512 mg/L, harboring mainly the rmtB
      (98.8%). All were carbapenemase producers. P. stuartii, P. mirabilis, and
      E. coli produced VIM-type carbapenemases. K. pneumoniae produced KPC- (n =
      34, 81.0%), OXA-48 (n = 4, 9.5%), KPC- and VIM- (n = 3, 7.1%), or only
      VIM-type (n = 1, 2.4%) enzymes. Two groups of similar IncC plasmids were
      detected one harboring rmtB1, bla(VEB-1), bla(OXA-10), and bla(TEM-1), and
      the other additionally bla(VIM-1) and bla(SHV-5). Among RMT-producing
      Enterobacterales, rmtB1 predominated and was associated with
      carbapenemase-encoding gene(s). Similar IncC plasmids carrying a
      multiresistant region, including ESBL genes, and in the case of
      VIM-producing isolates, the bla(VIM-1), were responsible for this
      dissemination. The co-dissemination of these genes poses a public health
      threat.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae infection and antimicrobial resistance among
      children are major concerns. The occurrence of hypervirulent K. pneumoniae
      (hvKp) infections is gradually increasing worldwide, and disinfectant
      resistance is also being reported. Carbapenem- and disinfectant-resistant
      hvKp infection has made clinical treatment and nosocomial infection
      control among children increasingly challenging. In this study,
      whole-genome sequencing was conducted among 34 Carba NP-positive
      carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP) strains, and the distribution of
      antibiotic resistance genes, virulence genes and disinfectant resistance
      genes was determined. Eleven distinct STs were identified, and most of
      them were ST11 (58.8%). Among the carbapenem resistance genes, KPC-2 was
      predominant (61.8%), followed by NDM-1 (26.5%) and IPM-4 (11.8%), and no
      other carbapenemase genes were found. Twelve virulence genes were
      investigated. All 34 CRKP strains carried the following virulence genes:
      rcsA/B, entA, fimA/H and mrkA/D. The gene iucB was present in only 3
      (8.9%) CRKP strains. The positive detection rates of the iroN and ybtA
      genes were 94.1% and 64.7%, respectively. None of the strains was found to
      carry the rmpA and iroB genes. Two disinfectant resistance genes were
      investigated in this study. Twenty-one (61.8%) strains carried both the
      qacE and cepA disinfectant resistance genes, 13 (38.2%) CRKP strains
      carried only the cepA gene, and no strains with only the qacE gene was
      detected. The correlations among virulence, drug resistance and
      disinfectant tolerance showed that the virulence and disinfectant
      resistance genes were distinct among several types of

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tigecycline is a therapeutic option for
      carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (CP-Kp). Our aim was to
      evaluate the impact of the tigecycline's minimum inhibitory concentration
      (MIC) in the outcome of patients with CP-Kp bacteraemia treated with
      tigecycline monotherapy. METHODS: Patients with monomicrobial bacteraemia
      due to CP-Kp that received appropriate targeted monotherapy or no
      appropriate treatment were included. Primary outcome was 30-day mortality.
      MICs of meropenem, tigecycline, and ceftazidime/avibactam were determined
      by Etest, whereas for colistin, the broth microdilution method was
      applied. PCR for bla(KPC), bla(VIM), bla(NDM), and bla(OXA) genes was
      applied. RESULTS: Among 302 CP-Kp bacteraemias, 32 isolates (10.6%) showed
      MICs of tigecycline ≤ 0.5 mg/L, whereas 177 (58.6%) showed MICs that were
      0.75-2 mg/L. Colistin and aminoglycoside susceptibility was observed in
      43.0% and 23.8% of isolates, respectively. The majority of isolates
      carried bla(KPC) (249; 82.5%), followed by bla(VIM) (26; 8.6%), both
      bla(KPC) and bla(VIM) (16; 5.3%), and bla(NDM) (11; 3.6%). Fifteen
      patients with tigecycline MIC ≤ 0.5 mg/L and 55 with MIC 0.75-2 mg/L were
      treated with tigecycline monotherapy; 30-day mortality was 20.0% and
      50.9%, respectively (p = 0.042). Mortality of 150 patients that received
      other antimicrobials was 24.7%; among 82 patients that received no
      appropriate treatment, mortality was 39.0%. No difference in 30-day
      mortality was observed between patients that received tigecycline (MIC ≤
      0.5 mg/L) or other antimicrobials. CONCLUSION: Tigecycline monotherapy was
      as efficacious as other antimicrobials in the treatment of bloodstream
      infections due to CP-Kp isolates with a tigecycline's MIC ≤ 0.5 mg/L.

TI  - Antimicrobial resistance profile of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases,
      adenosine-monophosphate-cyclic, and carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative
      bacteria isolated from domestic animals

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: The production of beta-lactamase enzymes, such as
      extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL), adenosine-monophosphate-cyclic
      (AmpC), and Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), is one of the most
      important mechanisms of bacterial resistance to antimicrobials.
      Gram-negative bacteria show significant resistance due to various
      intrinsic and acquired factors. These intrinsic factors include low
      permeability of the outer membrane, various efflux systems, and the
      production of beta-lactamases, while acquired factors include chromosomal
      mutation and acquisition of resistance genes by horizontal transfer.
      Mobile elements such as plasmids, integrative conjugative elements,
      mobilizable islands, or transposable elements are involved in horizontal
      transfer. At present, the Gram-negative pathogens of most concern are
      Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and those belonging to
      the Enterobacteriaceae family (e.g., Escherichia coli, K. pneumoniae, and
      Proteus mirabilis). This study aimed to evaluate the profile of
      antimicrobial resistance and the production of the enzymes ESBL, AmpC, and
      KPC, in 21 gram-negative bacteria isolated from domestic animals treated
      at the University Veterinary Hospital (HVU) of the Federal University of
      Western Bahia (UFOB). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The biological samples (21)
      were inoculated to brain heart infusion broth, blood agar, and MacConkey
      agar and incubated for 24-72 h at 37°C. Gram staining and identification
      through biochemical tests and matrix-associated laser
      desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry were conducted. To
      evaluate the antimicrobial resistance profile, the disk diffusion method
      was used, and 25 antibiotics were employed. For the detection of ESBL, the
      disk approximation method was applied using chromogenic agar. The presence
      of KPC was observed using chromogenic agar and the Hodge test. For AmpC
      evaluation, the disk approximation method was used. RESULTS: The most
      isolated agent was E. coli (66.66%, 14/21), followed by K. pneumoniae and
      P. mirabilis (both 14.29%, 3/21), and then Pasteurella spp. (4.76%, 1/21).
      The bacterial isolates showed high levels of resistance against
      clindamycin, penicillin, imipenem, polymyxin, cefoxitin, gentamycin,
      cefotaxime, ceftazidime, cephalothin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin,
      trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, and tetracycline. The best
      effectiveness rates were observed for cefepime, streptomycin,
      amoxicillin-clavulanate, aztreonam, nalidixic acid, tobramycin,
      levofloxacin, amikacin, and meropenem. All biological isolates showed
      multiple resistance to at least three of the antibiotics tested (3/25),
      and some showed resistance to 24 of the antibiotics tested (24/25). Among
      the 21 pathogens analyzed, 8 were ESBL producers (38.09%); of these, 6
      were identified as E. coli (28.57%), and 2 were identified as K.
      pneumoniae (9.52%). Two strains of K. pneumoniae produced both ESBL and
      KPC. None of the isolates were producers of AmpC. CONCLUSION: The results
      found in the present work raise concern about the level of antimicrobial
      resistance among pathogens isolated from domestic animals in Brazil. The
      results highlight the need for the development and implementation of
      anti-resistance strategies to avoid the dissemination of multiresistant
      pathogens, including the prudent use of antimicrobials and the
      implementation of bacterial culture, antimicrobial sensitivity, and
      phenotypic tests for the detection of beta-lactamase enzymes in bacteria
      isolated from animals.

CY  - Germany
AB  - To understand the reasons of successful spread of carbapenem-resistant
      Klebsiella pneumoniae ST14 (CRKP-ST14) in countries of the Arabian
      Peninsula, the resistome, capsular locus, carbapenemase carrying plasmid
      types, and core genome of isolates from the region were compared to global
      isolates. Thirty-nine CRKP-ST14 strains isolated from 13 hospitals in the
      United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia were selected for whole
      genome sequencing on Illumina MiSeq platform based on the variety of
      carbapenemase genes carried and plasmids bearing these genes. Their
      resistome, capsular locus, and core genome MLST were compared to 173
      CRKP-ST14 genomes available in public databases. The selected 39 CRKP-ST14
      produced either NDM-1, OXA-48, OXA-162, OXA-232, KPC-2, or co-produced
      NDM-1 and an OXA-48-like carbapenemase. cgMLST revealed three clusters: 16
      isolates from five UAE cities (C1), 11 isolates from three UAE cities and
      Bahrain (C2), and 5 isolates from Saudi Arabia (C3), respectively, and
      seven singletons. Resistance gene profile, carbapenemase genes, and their
      plasmid types were variable in both C1 and C2 clusters. The majority of
      CRKP-ST14 had KL2, but members of the C2 cluster and two further
      singletons possessed KL64 capsular locus. Based on cgMLST comparison of
      regional and global isolates, CRKP-ST14 with KL64 from four continents
      formed a distinct cluster, suggesting a recent emergence and spread of
      this variant. Our findings confirmed clonal transmission coupled with
      likely horizontal gene transfer in carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella
      pneumoniae ST14. Dissemination of this genetically flexible, highly
      resistant clone warrants further monitoring.

AB  - The rapid and ongoing spread of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae
      has led to a global health threat. However, a limited number of studies
      have addressed this problem in the marine environment. We investigated
      their emergence in the coastal waters of the central Adriatic Sea
      (Croatia), which are recipients of submarine effluents from two wastewater
      treatment plants. Fifteen KPC-producing Enterobacteriaceae (nine
      Escherichia coli, four Klebsiella pneumoniae and two Citrobacter freundii)
      were recovered, and susceptibility testing to 14 antimicrobials from 10
      classes showed that four isolates were extensively drug resistant (XDR)
      and two were resistant to colistin. After ERIC and BOX-PCR typing, eight
      isolates were selected for whole genome sequencing. The E. coli isolates
      belonged to serotype O21:H27 and sequence type (ST) 2795, while K.
      pneumoniae isolates were assigned to STs 37 and 534. Large-scale genome
      analysis revealed an arsenal of 137 genes conferring resistance to 19
      antimicrobial drug classes, 35 genes associated with virulence, and 20
      plasmid replicons. The isolates simultaneously carried 43-90 genes
      encoding for antibiotic resistance, while four isolates co-harbored
      carbapenemase genes bla (KPC-2) and bla (OXA-48). The bla (OXA-48) was
      associated with IncL-type plasmids in E. coli and K. pneumoniae.
      Importantly, the bla (KPC-2) in four E. coli isolates was located on ~40
      kb IncP6 broad-host-range plasmids which recently emerged as bla (KPC-2)
      vesicles, providing first report of these bla (KPC-2)-bearing resistance
      plasmids circulating in E. coli in Europe. This study also represents the
      first evidence of XDR and potentially virulent strains of KPC-producing E.
      coli in coastal waters and the co-occurrence of bla (KPC-2) and bla
      (OXA-48) carbapenemase genes in this species. The leakage of these strains
      through submarine effluents into coastal waters is of concern, indicating
      a reservoir of this infectious threat in the marine environment.

AB  - Polymyxin resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae has been attributed to
      mutations in mgrB, phoPQ, pmrAB, and crrAB and to the presence of mcr
      plasmid-mediated genes. Herein, we describe the molecular characteristics
      of 24 polymyxin- and carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates recovered
      from six Colombian cities between 2009 and 2019. Minimum inhibitory
      concentrations (MICs) to polymyxin were confirmed by broth microdilution,
      and whole-genome sequencing was performed to determine sequence type,
      resistome, and mutations in the genes related to polymyxin resistance, as
      well the presence of mcr. The results showed high-level resistance to
      polymyxin (MICs ≥ 4 μg/mL). bla(KPC-3) was present in the majority of
      isolates (17/24; 71%), followed by bla(KPC-2) (6/24; 25%) and bla(NDM-1)
      (1/24; 4%). Most isolates belonged to the CG258 (17/24; 71%) and presented
      amino acid substitutions in PmrB (22/24; 92%) and CrrB (15/24; 63%);
      mutations in mgrB occurred in only five isolates (21%). Additional
      mutations in pmrA, crrA, and phoPQ nor any of the mcr resistance genes
      were identified. In conclusion, we found clonal dissemination of polymyxin
      and carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates in Colombia, mainly
      associated with CG258 and bla(KPC-3). Surveillance of this
      multidrug-resistant clone is warranted due to the limited therapeutic
      options for the treatment of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae
      infections.

AB  - Treatment of infections caused by OXA-48 carbapenemase producing
      multidrug-resistant isolates often necessitates combination therapy. In
      vitro effect of different antibiotic combinations against
      multidrug-resistant (MDR) Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates were evaluated in
      this study. Meropenem-tobramycin (MER+TOB), meropenem-ciprofloxacin
      (MER+CIP), colistin-meropenem (COL+MER), colistin-ciprofloxacin (COL+CIP)
      and colistin-tobramycin (COL+TOB) combinations were tested by time
      kill-assays. Each antibiotic alone and in combination at their Cmax values
      were tested against 4 clinical K. pneumoniae isolates at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12
      and 24 h. Effect of colistin and its associations were also assessed at 30
      min. Bactericidal activity was defined as ≥3log10 CFU mL-1 decrease
      compared with initial inoculum. Synergy was defined as ≥2log10CFU mL-1
      decrease by the combination compared with the most active single agent.
      Presence of bla OXA-48, bla NDM, bla VIM, bla IMP, bla KPC and bla CTX-M-1
      genes was screened by PCR using specific primers. The bla OXA-48 gene was
      identified together with bla CTXM-1 group gene in all isolates. COL+MER
      demonstrated to be synergistic and bactericidal. MER+TOB showed
      synergistic and bactericidal effect on two strains although, regrowth was
      seen on other two strains at 24 h. MER+CIP exhibited indifferent effect on
      the strains. Combination therapy could be a potential alternative to treat
      MDR K. pneumoniae infections. This combination might prevent resistance
      development and secondary effects of colistin monotherapy. MER+TOB and
      MER+CIP might have an isolate-dependent effect, that may not always result
      in synergism.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is an increasing and urgent issue for human
      health worldwide, as it leads to the reduction of available antibiotics to
      treat bacterial infections, in turn increasing hospital stays and
      lethality. Therefore, the study and genomic surveillance of bacterial
      carriers of resistance in and outside of clinical settings is of utter
      importance. A colony of multidrug resistant (MDR) bacteria identified as
      Klebsiella spp., by 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing, has been isolated from
      an urban lake in Brazil, during a drug-degrading bacterial prospection.
      Genomic analyses revealed the bacteria as Klebsiella pneumoniae species.
      Furthermore, the in silico Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST) identified
      the genome as a new sequence type, ST5236. The search for antimicrobial
      resistance genes (ARGs) detected the presence of genes against
      beta-lactams, fosfomycin, acriflavine and efflux pumps, as well as genes
      for heavy metal resistance. Of particular note, an extended-spectrum
      beta-lactamase gene (blaCTX-M-15) has been detected in close proximity to
      siphoviridae genes, while a carbapenemase gene (KPC-2) has been found in
      an extrachromosomal contig, within a novel non-Tn4401 genetic element
      (NTE(KPC)). An extrachromosomal contig found in the V3 isolate is
      identical to a contig of a K. pneumoniae isolate from a nearby hospital,
      which indicates a putative gene flow from the hospital network into
      Paranoá lake. The discovery of a MDR isolate in this lake is worrisome, as
      the region has recently undergone periods of water scarcity causing the
      lake, which receives treated wastewater effluent, and is already used for
      recreational purposes, to be used as an environmental buffer for drinking
      water reuse. Altogether, our results indicate an underrepresentation of
      environmental K. pneumoniae among available genomes, which may hamper the
      understanding of the population dynamics of the species in the environment
      and its consequences in the spread of ARGs and virulence genes.

AB  - The p-traps of hospital handwashing sinks represent a potential reservoir
      for antimicrobial-resistant organisms of major public health concern, such
      as carbapenemase-producing KPC+ Klebsiella pneumoniae (CPKP).
      Bacteriophages have reemerged as potential biocontrol agents, particularly
      against biofilm-associated, drug-resistant microorganisms. The primary
      objective of our study was to formulate a phage cocktail capable of
      targeting a CPKP strain (CAV1016) at different stages of colonization
      within polymicrobial drinking water biofilms using a CDC biofilm reactor
      (CBR) p-trap model. A cocktail of four CAV1016 phages, all exhibiting
      depolymerase activity, were isolated from untreated wastewater using
      standard methods. Biofilms containing Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Micrococcus
      luteus, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia, Elizabethkingia anophelis,
      Cupriavidus metallidurans, and Methylobacterium fujisawaense were
      established in the CBR p-trap model for a period of 28 d. Subsequently,
      CAV1016 was inoculated into the p-trap model and monitored over a period
      of 21 d. Biofilms were treated for 2 h at either 25 °C or 37 °C with the
      phage cocktail (10(9) PFU/ml) at 7, 14, and 21 d post-inoculation. The
      effect of phage treatment on the viability of biofilm-associated CAV1016
      was determined by plate count on m-Endo LES agar. Biofilm heterotrophic
      plate counts (HPC) were determined using R2A agar. Phage titers were
      determined by plaque assay. Phage treatment reduced biofilm-associated
      CAV1016 viability by 1 log(10) CFU/cm(2) (p 0.05) at any time point or
      temperature. Supplementation with a non-ionic surfactant appears to
      enhance phage association within biofilms. The results of this study
      suggest the potential of phages to control CPKP and other
      carbapenemase-producing organisms associated with microbial biofilms in
      the healthcare environment.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The convergence of carbapenem-resistance and hypervirulence in
      Klebsiella pneumoniae has led to a significant public health challenge. In
      recent years, there have been more and more reports on
      carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-hvKP)
      isolates. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical data of patients infected with
      CR-hvKP from January 2019 to December 2020 in a tertiary hospital were
      retrospectively evaluated. The number of isolates of Klebsiella
      pneumoniae, hypermucoviscous Klebsiella pneumoniae (hmKP),
      carbapenem-resistant hypermucoviscous Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-hmKP) and
      carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-hvKP)
      collected during the period of 2 years was calculated. The antimicrobial
      resistance gene, virulence-associated gene, capsular serotype gene and
      multilocus sequence typing (MLST) of CR-hvKP isolates were detected by
      PCR. RESULTS: During the study period, a total of 1081 isolates of
      non-repeat Klebsiella pneumoniae were isolated, including 392 isolates of
      hypermucoviscous Klebsiella pneumoniae (36.3%), 39 isolates of CR-hmKP
      (3.6%), and 16 isolates of CR-hvKP (1.5%). About 31.2% (5/16) of CR-hvKP
      were isolated from 2019, and 68.8% (11/16) of CR-hvKP were isolated from
      2020. Among the 16 isolates of CR-hvKP, 13 isolates were ST11 and serotype
      K64, 1 isolate was ST11 and serotype K47, 1 isolate was ST23 and serotype
      K1, and 1 isolate was ST86 and serotype K2. The virulence-associated genes
      entB, fimH, rmpA2, iutA, iucA were present in all of 16 CR-hvKP isolates,
      followed by mrkD (n=14), rmpA (n=13), aerobactin (n=2), allS (n=1).
      Sixteen CR-hvKP isolates all carry carbapenemase gene bla (KPC-2) and
      extended-spectrum β-lactamase gene bla (SHV). ERIC-PCR DNA fingerprinting
      results showed that 16 CR-hvKP isolates were highly polymorphic, and there
      were significant differences in bands among the isolates, presenting a
      sporadic state. CONCLUSION: Although CR-hvKP was sporadically distributed,
      it showed an increasing trend year by year. Therefore, clinical attention
      should be paid, and necessary measures should be taken to avoid the
      cloning and transmission of superbacterium CR-hvKP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) are rapidly
      increasing worldwide in last two decades and lead few antibiotics for
      treatment. The molecular epidemiology of CRE in China was investigated to
      provide basis for clinical rational use of antibiotics and prevent its
      spread. METHODS: All CRE isolates in this study were collected from 11
      hospitals from October 2015 to July 2018. The isolates were subjected to
      antimicrobial susceptibility tests, PCR molecular identification,
      pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, and multilocus sequence typing. RESULTS:
      Among the 399 CRE isolates, 51.6% (206/399) harbored carbapenemase genes.
      Three carbapenemase genes were detected, namely bla (KPC-2), bla (NDM-1),
      and bla (IMP) at rates of 29.8% (119/399), 17.5% (70/399), and 4.0%
      (16/399), respectively. In Klebsiella pneumoniae (350) and Escherichia
      coli (26), bla (KPC-2) (33.4%, 117/350) and bla (NDM-1) (61.5%, 16/26)
      were the predominant genes. The most common genes in the CRE isolates were
      bla (KPC) (85.5%) and bla (NDM-1) (76.5%) from adults and children,
      respectively. Particularly, ST11 K. pneumoniae with bla (KPC-2) harbored
      by IncFII plasmids were distributed in both general and primary hospitals,
      suggesting a clonal transmission pattern at these sites. In addition, the
      clonal distribution of ST2407 K. pneumoniae with bla (NDM-1) located on
      IncX3 plasmids and bla (IMP-38)-positive ST307 K. pneumoniae were detected
      in a children's hospital. CONCLUSION: The distribution of carbapenemase
      genes differed among strains and age groups. Multiple carbapenemase genes
      in the CRE strains were clonally disseminated in the tested regions
      mediated by multiple plasmids. Therefore, CRE monitoring should be
      increased and measures should be adopted to prevent its transmission.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) is a serious
      threat to health, and the detection rate in intensive care units (ICUs) is
      relatively high. We compared regional differences in the clinical and
      molecular characteristics of CRKP from three ICUs in different hospitals,
      to make a reference and contribution for infection control and clinical
      medication. METHODS: A total of 150 CRKP strains from Chongqing, Beijing,
      and Nantong, as well as the clinical data of the infected patients, were
      collected between 2019 and 2021. The carbapenemase phenotype was
      determined by CarbaNP test, and the outer membrane porin (OMP) genes
      (ompK35/ompK36), multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and resistance genes
      were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and
      sequencing. RESULTS: Patients infected with CRKP were mainly elderly, with
      comorbidity, and had undergone invasive operation and multiple antibiotic
      therapy. All strains exhibited high-level resistance to most antibiotics
      except for polymyxin B and tigecycline. Among the CRKP strains, 100 had
      the bla (KPC-2) gene and 8 had bla (NDM-1) gene, which were distributed in
      all of the hospitals. Nearly all the strains harbored extended-spectrum
      beta-lactamase (ESBL) genes (bla (SHV), bla (CTX-M), and bla (TEM)). Class
      C carbapenemase genes (bla (CIT), bla (DHA)), and deletion and mutation of
      ompK35/ompK36 existed in some strains. ST11 was the main MLST type,
      followed by ST15. CONCLUSIONS: There were a few significant differences in
      the molecular epidemiology and clinical characteristics, but generally the
      features of CRKP from the three ICUs aligned fairly well, which might have
      resulted from dissemination through frequent personnel exchanges between
      regions.

AB  - The convergence of a vulnerable population and a notorious pathogen is
      devastating, as seen in the case of sepsis occurring during the first 28
      days of life (neonatal period). Sepsis leads to mortality, particularly in
      low-income countries (LICs) and lower-middle-income countries (LMICs).
      Klebsiella pneumoniae, an opportunistic pathogen is a leading cause of
      neonatal sepsis. The success of K. pneumoniae as a pathogen can be
      attributed to its multidrug-resistance and hypervirulent-pathotype. Though
      the WHO still recommends ampicillin and gentamicin for the treatment of
      neonatal sepsis, K. pneumoniae is rapidly becoming untreatable in this
      susceptible population. With escalating rates of cephalosporin use in
      health-care settings, the increasing dependency on carbapenems, a "last
      resort antibiotic," has led to the emergence of carbapenem-resistant K.
      pneumoniae (CRKP). CRKP is reported from around the world causing
      outbreaks of neonatal infections. Carbapenem resistance in CRKP is largely
      mediated by highly transmissible plasmid-encoded carbapenemase enzymes,
      including KPC, NDM, and OXA-48-like enzymes. Further, the emergence of a
      more invasive and highly pathogenic hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKP)
      pathotype in the clinical context poses an additional challenge to the
      clinicians. The deadly package of resistance and virulence has already
      limited therapeutic options in neonates with a compromised defense system.
      Although there are reports of CRKP infections, a review on neonatal sepsis
      due to CRKP/ hvKP is scarce. Here, we discuss the current understanding of
      neonatal sepsis with a focus on the global impact of the CRKP, provide a
      perspective regarding the possible acquisition and transmission of the
      CRKP and/or hvKP in neonates, and present strategies to effectively
      identify and combat these organisms.

CY  - Netherlands
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cefiderocol is a novel catechol-substituted siderophore
      cephalosporin with broad-spectrum activity against Gram-negative
      pathogens. However, variation of its activity among carbapenemase
      producers from various regions and countries has been reported. Here, we
      checked the in vitro activity against Gram-negative carbapenem
      non-susceptible bacteria collected in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: Cefiderocol
      MICs were determined using the iron-depleted CAMHB media and interpreted
      according to CLSI guidelines. Isolates (n=288) included
      carbapenemase-producing Escherichia coli (n=46), Klebsiella pneumoniae
      (n=98), Acinetobacter baumannii (n=65) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n=79)
      clinical isolates. RESULTS: Cefiderocol inhibited 73.26% (211/288) of the
      isolates studied at concentrations of ≤ 4 mg/L. Cefiderocol inhibited all
      carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii isolates (65/65, 100%) producing
      OXA-23-like, OXA-24-like and NDM, and nearly all P. aeruginosa isolates
      (75/79, 94.94%), including those producing VIM and NDM. In contrast, the
      carbapenemase-producing isolates from the Enterobacterales group
      demonstrated significantly higher MICs with only 53.06% (52/98) of K.
      pneumoniae and 41.3% (19/46) of E. coli isolates exhibiting MICs of ≤ 4
      mg/L. Isolates showing elevated MICs (73/144, 50.69%) included NDM (20/29,
      68.97%), NDM/OXA-48-like (34/59, 57.63%), OXA-48-like (18/52, 34.62%) and
      KPC (1/4, 25%) producers, thus showing no clear association with the
      production of serine-type or metallo-type carbapenemases. However, high
      cefiderocol MICs (≥ 32mg/L) were associated with isolates producing NDM,
      and in particular, among those coproducing the OXA-232-type enzyme.
      CONCLUSIONS: Cefiderocol had excellent activity against multi-drug
      resistant non-fermenters Gram-negative pathogens. Reasons behind the high
      cefiderocol MICs in certain Enterobacterales isolates need further
      investigation.

AB  - RATIONALE: Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae, KP) are divided into two
      types: classic K. pneumoniae (cKP) and hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (hvKP).
      hvKP causes liver abscess and metastatic infection. Here, we report one
      case with pyogenic liver abscess (PLA) and endogenous endophthalmitis (EE)
      due to a relatively rarely reported serotype of K. pneumoniae in China.
      PATIENT CONCERNS: An 80-year old man presented with nausea, vomiting, and
      epigastric discomfort for 2 weeks. DIAGNOSES: PLA was identified by CT
      scan and abdominal ultrasound. Urgent ophthalmologic consultation was
      performed. B-scan ocular ultrasound was done and he was diagnosed as EE.
      INTERVENTIONS: Antibiotic treatment, intravitreal injection of eyes and
      eye drops were given. Percutaneous needle aspiration, evisceration, and
      drainage of the right eye were performed. OUTCOMES: Cultures of the blood,
      the aspirated pus from the liver abscess, and the contents of the eyeball
      all yielded K. pneumoniae with a positive string test. The capsular
      serotype was K64. According to the existence of multiple virulence genes
      and the severe invasive clinical manifestation, this strain is regarded as
      a hvKp strain. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) revealed the sequence
      type (ST) of this strain was K64-ST1764. Antimicrobial resistance genes,
      bla (NDM-1) and bla (KPC-2), were not detected in the genome. The patient
      lost his eyesight but his symptoms subsided. During 15 months follow-up,
      the result was satisfactory. LESSONS: Here, we report one case with PLA
      due to a relatively rarely reported serotype of K. pneumoniae in China.
      This K64 K. pneumoniae strain is confirmed as hvKp by multiple methods. It
      is noteworthy that the sequence type is K64-ST1764 instead of the
      commonest ST11. Moreover, this strain is not considered a K. pneumoniae
      carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) or a carbapenem-resistant
      K. pneumoniae (CRKP) as it is usually. Further follow-up and research are
      required to investigate this strain.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) has been
      widespread in coastal cities of eastern China since 2009. However, how
      CRKP spreads and evolves in southwest China is unclear. AIM: We
      investigated the genetic characteristics and dissemination mechanisms of
      carbapenemase genes in forty-one non-repetitive CRKP isolates collected
      from a southwest hospital, Kunming, Yunnan, during 2010-2013. METHODOLOGY:
      Drug susceptibilities were analyzed by using VITEK 2 compact system.
      Genetic relationships were ascertained based on multilocus sequence typing
      (MLST) and Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis. Genetic
      backgrounds of bla (KPC-2) and bla (NDM-1) were revealed by DNA walking
      and high-throughput sequencing. RESULTS: All isolates were highly
      resistant to common antibiotics except for tigecycline. In total, 34 bla
      (KPC-2), 3 bla (NDM-1), 1 bla (IMP-4) and 3 bla (IMP-26) genes were
      identified and KP67 plasmid 1 co-harbored bla (NDM-1) and bla (IMP-26).
      Five sequence types, namely ST11, ST290, ST340, ST395 and ST437, were
      recognized by MLST. Surprisingly, bla (KPC-2) was only detected in ST11
      strains. We described a clonal dissemination of fosA3-positive
      IncR-IncF33:A-:B- multireplicon plasmid carrying the gene cassettes
      IS26-ΔTn3-ISKpn27-bla (KPC-2)-ΔISKpn6-korC-klcA-ΔrepB-Tn1721 in all ST11
      isolates. Three bla (NDM-1) positive isolates belonged to three different
      ST types and their bla (NDM-1) genetic backgrounds were also distinct.
      Interestingly, the flanking regions of bla (NDM-1) in KP67 and KP72 were
      duplicated into one to five copies in a form of tandem repeat by the
      transposition of IS91 like element. The bla (NDM-1) of KP82 was carried on
      a common IncX3 plasmid. CONCLUSION: This study described the early
      epidemiological characteristics of bla (KPC-2)/bla (NDM-1)-carrying CRKP,
      and reported a new tandem repeat pattern of bla (NDM-1) cluster in Yunnan.
      These findings extend our knowledge on the carbapenemase gene evolutions.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: During the lockdown that started in Italy on 10 March 2020 to
      address the COVID-19 pandemic, aggressive procedures were implemented to
      prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission in SARS-CoV-2-negative patients with
      haematological malignancies. These efforts progressively reduced
      Klebsiella pneumonia carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae (KPC-KP) spread
      among these patients. Here we evaluated the potential effects of measures
      against COVID-19 that reduced KPC-KP transmission. PATIENTS AND METHODS:
      We analysed KPC-KP spread among 123 patients with haematological
      malignancies, hospitalized between March and August 2020, who were managed
      using measures against COVID-19. Their outcomes were compared with those
      of 80 patients hospitalized during the preceding 4 months (November
      2019-February 2020). RESULTS: During March-August 2020, 15.5% of
      hospitalized patients were KPC-KP positive, compared with 52.5% in
      November 2019-February 2020 (P < 0.0001); 8% and 27.5% of patients in
      these two groups were newly KPC-KP positive, respectively (P = 0.0003).
      There were eight new KPC-KP-positive patients during January 2020 and none
      during June 2020. The weekly rate of hospitalized KPC-KP-positive patients
      decreased from 50% during March 2020 to 17% during August 2020. Four
      KPC-KP bloodstream infections (BSIs) were experienced by 123 patients (3%)
      in March-August 2020, and seven BSIs (one fatal) by 80 patients (8%) in
      November 2019-February 2020 (P = 0.02). Consumption and expense of
      ceftazidime/avibactam administered to KPC-KP-positive patients
      significantly decreased in March-August 2020. CONCLUSIONS: Aggressive
      strategies to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission were applied to all
      hospitalized patients, characterized by high levels of KPC-KP endemicity
      and nosocomial transmission. Such measures prevented SARS-CoV-2 infection
      acquisition and KPC-KP horizontal transmission. Reduced KPC-KP spread,
      fewer associated clinical complications and decreased
      ceftazidime/avibactam consumption represented unexpected 'collateral
      benefits' of strategies to prevent COVID-19.

AB  - Carbapenemase-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CR-KP) has become one of
      the nosocomial infections that seriously threaten the lives of patients,
      greatly increasing the burden on patients. In order to explore the
      resistance mechanism of clinically isolated CR-KP to carbapenems and
      perform multilocus sequence typing (MLST), to study the clinical
      characteristics of patients with different ST types of infection, we
      collected 74 CR-KP strains clinically isolated from the main 6 hospitals
      in Zhejiang province from January 2018 to July 2020. The sensitivity of
      the tested strains to 23 antibacterial drugs was determined by the
      microbroth dilution method, and PCR was applied. Gene amplification
      technology and DNA sequencing methods were used to detect the
      carbapenemase gene of the tested strains. Through the MLST of the tested
      strains, the clonal correlation and molecular epidemiological
      characteristics of the tested strains were explored, and the
      characteristics of CR-KP resistance, resistance mechanisms, and clinical
      characteristics of bacterial infections under different MLST types were
      analyzed at the same time. The results showed that 74 carbapenem-resistant
      Klebsiella pneumoniae strains showed high resistance to 21 commonly used
      antibacterial drugs, and all carbapenemase phenotypic screening tests were
      positive. MLST typing showed that 74 CR-KP strains had 17 ST typings, and
      ST11 was the dominant type (54.05%). The study also found that these ST11
      strains are more likely to be resistant to carbapenem antibiotics. Most of
      them produce KPC carbapenemase, and a few are IMP, VIM, and NDM.
      Univariate analysis suggested that the proportion of patients in the ST11
      group receiving treatment in ICU, the use rate of mechanical ventilation,
      and the proportion of drainage tube indwelling were higher than those in
      the non-ST11 group, and the survival rate of the ST11 group was lower than
      that of the non-ST11 group. Clinical data suggested that the same hospital
      was dominated by the same clonal epidemic in the same period. In view of
      the analysis of clinical data suggesting that patients who have received
      ICU treatment, mechanical ventilation, and drainage tube indwelling are
      prone to the risk of CR-KP strain (especially ST11) infection and low
      survival rate, such patients should arouse extensive clinical attention.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) are common causes
      of healthcare-associated infections and are often multidrug resistant with
      limited therapeutic options. Additionally, CRE can spread within and
      between healthcare facilities, amplifying potential harms. OBJECTIVE: To
      better understand the burden, risk factors, and source of acquisition of
      carbapenemase genes in clinical Escherichia coli and Klebsiella spp
      isolates from patients in Washington to guide prevention efforts. DESIGN:
      Multicenter prospective surveillance study. METHODS: Escherichia coli and
      Klebsiella spp isolates meeting the Washington state CRE surveillance case
      definition were solicited from clinical laboratories and tested at
      Washington Public Health Laboratories using polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR) for the 5 most common carbapenemase genes: blaKPC, blaNDM, blaIMP,
      blaVIM, and blaOXA-48. Case patients positive by PCR were investigated by
      the public health department. RESULTS: From October 2012 through December
      2017, 363 carbapenem-resistant E. coli and Klebsiella spp isolates were
      tested. Overall, 45 of 115 carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (39%), 1 of
      8 K. oxytoca (12.5%), and 28 of 239 carbapenem-resistant E. coli (11.7%)
      were carbapenemase positive. Of 74 carbapenemase-positive isolates, blaKPC
      was most common (47%), followed by blaNDM (30%), blaOXA-48 (22%), and
      blaIMP (1%). Although all cases had healthcare exposure, blaKPC
      acquisition was associated with US health care, whereas non-blaKPC
      acquisition was associated with international health care or travel.
      CONCLUSIONS: We report that blaKPC, the most prevalent carbapenemase in
      the United States, accounts for nearly half of carbapenemase cases in
      Washington state and that most KPC-cases are likely acquired through
      in-state health care.

AB  - We set out to study the prevalence of the mcr-1 gene in
      carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (CPKP) strains, and to
      determine whether its presence is associated with a fitness cost. A total
      of 234 clinical CPKP isolates were collected from a tertiary medical
      center in Taiwan from January 2018 to January 2019. The mcr-1 and
      carbapenemase genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
      followed by Sanger sequencing. The mcr-1-positive carbapenemase-producing
      strain was characterized by whole genome sequencing, a plasmid stability
      test and a conjugation assay. In vitro growth rate and an in vivo
      virulence test were compared between the parental mcr-1-positive strain
      and its mcr-1 plasmid-cured strain. We identified only one mcr-1 positive
      strain (KP2509), co-harboring bla (KPC-) (2) and bla (OXA-) (48), among
      234 (1/234, 0.43%) CPKP strains. KP2509 and its Escherichia coli mcr-1
      transconjugant showed moderate colistin resistance (MIC = 8 mg/L). The
      mcr-1 is located on a large conjugative plasmid (317 kb), pKP2509-MCR,
      with three replicons, IncHI, IncFIB, and IncN. Interestingly, a complete
      Type IV-A3 CRISPR-Cas system was identified in pKP2509-MCR. Plasmid
      pKP2509-MCR was highly stable in KP2509 after 270 generation of passage,
      and the pKP2509-MCR cured strain PC-KP2509 showed similar growth rate and
      in vivo virulence in comparison to KP2509. The prevalence of mcr-1 in CPKP
      strains remains low in our center. Notably, we identified a large plasmid
      with multiple replicons containing both the mcr-1 and the Type IV-3A
      CRISPR-Cas genes. The further spread of this highly stable plasmid raises
      concern that it may promote the increase of mcr-1 prevalence in CPKP.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae
      (CRKP) has emerged rapidly in China with the abuse and overuse of
      antibiotics, and infections caused by CRKP pose a serious threat to global
      public health safety. The present study aimed to explore the
      epidemiological characteristics of CRKP isolates in Northern China and to
      elucidate their drug resistance mechanisms. METHODS: 45 CRKP strains were
      consecutively collected at a teaching hospital from March 1st, 2018 to
      June 30th, 2018. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined by the VITEK2
      compact system and microbroth dilution method. Polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR) and sequencing were used to analyze multilocus sequence typing
      (MLST), drug resistance determinants, and plasmid types. The transfer of
      resistance genes was determined by conjugation. All statistical analysis
      was performed using SPSS 22.0 software. RESULTS: All 45 isolates showed
      multidrug resistance (MDR). MLST analysis showed ST11 (48.9%, 22/45) was
      the most frequent type. All of the 45 CRKP isolates contained
      carbapenemase genes, extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) genes, and
      plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance (PMQR) genes. For carbapenemase
      genes, KPC-2 (93.3%, 42/45) was the main genotype, and followed by GES
      (37.8%, 17/45) and NDM-1 (11.1%, 5/45). Plasmid typing analysis showed
      that IncFII and IncFIB were the most prevalent plasmids. The carbapenem
      resistance rate of K.pneumoniae was 11.4% and ICU was the main CRKP
      infection source. CONCLUSIONS: ST11 is the most frequent sequence type and
      KPC-2 is the predominant carbapenemase of CRKP strains in Northern China.
      KPC-2-ST11 are representative clonal lineages.

AB  - We report an outbreak of carbapenemase-producing hypervirulent Klebsiella
      pneumoniae in two hospitals that undergo frequent patient transfers.
      Analysis of 11 completely assembled genomes showed that the bacteria were
      ST11-K64 strains. Moreover, 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
      identified the strains as having originated from the same cluster, and
      were also indicative of the interhospital transmission of infection. Five
      plasmids were assembled in each of the strains. One plasmid carried
      several virulence genes, including the capsular polysaccharide regulators
      rmpA and rmpA2. Two others carried antimicrobial-resistance genes,
      including one for carbapenem resistance, bla (KPC-2). Comparative genomic
      analysis indicated the occurrence of frequent and rapid gain and loss of
      genomic content along transmissions and the co-existence of progeny
      strains in the same ward. A 10-kbp fragment harboring antimicrobial
      resistance-conferring genes flanked by insert sequences was missing in a
      plasmid from strain KP20194c in patient 3, and this strain also likely
      subsequently infected patient 4. However, strains containing the 10-kbp
      fragment were also isolated from the ward environment at approximately the
      same time, and harbored different chromosome indels. Tn1721 and multiple
      additional insert sequence-mediated transpositions were also seen. These
      results indicated that there is a rapid reshaping and diversification of
      the genomic pool of K. pneumoniae facilitated by mobile genetic elements,
      even a short time after outbreak onset. ST11-K64 CR-hvKP strains have the
      potential to become new significant superbugs and a threat to public
      health.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) causes
      community-acquired and hospital-acquired pneumonia. The mortality rates of
      invasive infections caused by hypervirulent K. pneumoniae (HvKP) are
      extremely high. However, the microbiological characteristics and clinical
      manifestations of K. pneumoniae in AnHui province still remain unclear.
      PURPOSE: To show the high prevalence of HvKP infections regarding clinical
      characteristics and antimicrobial resistance in Anhui province. PATIENTS
      AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted to study the clinical
      data of 115 strains of K. pneumoniae from July 2019 to March 2020 in The
      First Affiliated Hospital of AnHui Medical University. The virulence
      genes, capsular types, carbapenemase genes, and molecular subtypes of
      these hypervirulent isolates were detected. RESULTS: Overall, 59.1%
      (68/115) cases were HvKP infections, mainly from the department of
      intensive care unit (ICU, n=14, 20.6%) and the department of respiratory
      and critical care (n=13, 19.1%). K2 was the most prevalent capsular
      serotype (n=26), followed by K1 (n=21). The results of MLST identification
      of 68 strains showed that ST23 (n=15, 22.1%) was the most common type of
      ST, followed by ST11 and ST65 (n=12, 17.6%), ST86 (n=9, 13.2%), and ST412
      (n=6, 8.8%). Among 68 hvKP strains, 12 isolates were carbapenem resistant,
      and all except two harboured KPC. CONCLUSION: The high incidence of
      carbapenemase producing HvKP in the Anhui province, especially the higher
      mortality of HvKP, should be paid more attention. Meanwhile,
      epidemiological surveillance and clinical treatment strategies should be
      continuously determined and implemented.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Carbapenem resistance is endemic in the Indian sub-continent.
      In this study, carbapenem resistance rates and the prevalence of different
      carbapenemases were determined in Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae,
      Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa during two periods;
      Pre-COVID (August to October 2019) and COVID (January to February 2021) in
      a north-Indian tertiary care hospital. METHODS: Details of patient
      demographics and clinical condition was collated from the Hospital
      Information System and detection of carbapenemases NDM, OXA-48, VIM, IMP
      and KPC was done by Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in 152 and 138
      non-consecutive carbapenem resistant isolates during the two study periods
      respectively. Conjugation assay and sequencing of NDM and OXA-48 gene was
      done on a few selected isolates. RESULTS: As compared to Pre-COVID period,
      co-morbidities and the mortality rates were higher in patients harbouring
      carbapenem resistant organisms during the COVID period. The overall
      carbapenem resistance rate for all the four organisms increased from 23 to
      41% between the two periods of study; with Pseudomonas aeruginosa and
      Klebsiella pneumoniae showing significant increase (p < 0.05). OXA-48, NDM
      and co-expression of NDM and OXA-48 were the most common genotypes
      detected. NDM-5 and OXA-232 were most common variants of NDM and OXA-48

      of carbapenem resistance in COVID times could be attributed to increase in
      number of patients with co-morbidities. However, genetic elements of
      carbapenem resistance largely remained the same in the two time periods.

AB  - This study aimed to characterize a Klebsiella pneumoniae strain (KP411)
      recovered from the stool samples of poultry (Gallus gallus) in the
      Brazilian Amazon Region. The whole-genome sequencing of KP411 revealed the
      presence of an important arsenal of antimicrobial resistance genes to
      β-lactams (bla(CTX-M-14), bla(TEM-1B), bla(KPC-2), bla(SVH-11)),
      aminoglycosides [aph(3″)- Ib, aph(6)-Id, aph(3')-Ia], sulfonamides (sul1,
      sul2), quinolones (oqxAB), fosfomycin (fosA(KP)), and macrolides [mph(A)].
      Furthermore, our analyses revealed that the KP411 strain belongs to the
      ST258 clonal lineage, which is one of the main epidemic clones responsible
      for the dissemination of KPC-2 worldwide. Our data suggest that
      food-producing animals may act as reservoirs of multidrug-resistant K.

AB  - The emergence and spread of carbapenem-resistant hypervirulent Klebsiella
      pneumoniae sequence type 11 (ST11-CR-HvKP) in China are a great concern in
      the public health community. However, the underlying mechanism that
      enables its wide dissemination in China remains unclear. Here, we
      investigated the prevalence of carriage of carbapenemase-producing
      Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) among inpatients with diarrhea in a teaching
      hospital over 1 year to identify ST11-CR-HvKP reservoirs and to understand
      the genetic background and plasmid profiles of these pathogens. As
      assessed by stool analysis, the CPE colonization rate (12.4%) among the
      inpatients with diarrhea was high (12.4%). Antibiotic exposure, surgical
      history, and CPE positivity were correlated. Genomic investigation of 65
      carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates indicated a shared bacterial
      population in various wards. According to maximum likelihood phylogenetic
      tree analysis, these isolates were partitioned into three major clades.
      Analysis of the wzi locus revealed three different K types (KL105, KL47,
      and K64) among the ST11 isolates, indicating the genetic diversity of
      these isolates. Genetic and sequence mapping revealed the complexity of
      virulence and resistance plasmid sets harbored by the isolates. These
      observations indicate that the dissemination of resistant bacteria is more
      complex than initially anticipated and possibly involves multiple K.
      pneumoniae ST11 lineages and a variety of virulence plasmids.
      Collectively, we show for the first time that stool may be a source of
      ST11-CR-HvKP isolates. Furthermore, the findings reveal the silent
      dissemination of ST11-CR-HvKP bacteria in Zhejiang Province, China. Future
      investigations are warranted to determine the association between rectal
      colonization by ST11-CR-HvKP and clinical infections.IMPORTANCE China has
      been experiencing a rapid increase in the number of nosocomial infections
      caused by carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae ST11 (ST11-CRKP) for
      decades. The emergence of hypervirulent ST11-CRKP (ST11-CR-HvKP) strains
      is expected to become a serious public health issue in China, considering
      that carbapenem resistance and virulence have converged in an epidemic
      clone. K. pneumoniae strains that colonize the human intestinal tract may
      become a reservoir of virulence and carbapenemase-encoding genes. Here, we
      first characterized the genotypes and antimicrobial phenotypes of
      ST11-CR-HvKP strains isolated from diarrheal stool samples of inpatients
      in Zhejiang Province, China. Active surveillance approaches based on the
      findings of the present study should be implemented, particularly in
      intensive care units, to combat the spread of ST11-CR-HvKP and to improve
      treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the genotypes of the carbapenemases reported from
      microbiological isolates of patients in Peru. METHODS: A systematic search
      of the biomedical literature about carbapenemases with genotypic
      confirmation was carried out. It included literature published from 1
      January 2000 through 15 September 2019 in the PubMed, SCOPUS, Virtual
      Health Library, CONCYTEC Virtual Library, and Google Scholar databases,
      and other sources for the publication of abstracts or posters from
      national or international meetings. Two reviewers carried out the data
      selection and extraction. RESULTS: Fourteen studies, which carried out the
      genotypic characterization of 313 carbapenemases, were included. Of the
      total 313 reports, 103 analyzed enterobacteria: 74 were of Klebsiella
      pneumoniae, 11 of Proteus mirabilis, 7 of Enterobacter cloacae, and 11 of
      other enterobacteria; and 61 corresponded to bla (NDM) , 39 to bla (KPC,)
      and 3 to bla (IMP) . According to their molecular structure, 64 were
      metallo-ß-lactamases and 39 were serine-ß-lactamases. Of the total
      reports, 84 analyzed Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 79 corresponded to bla (IMP)
      , 4 to bla (VIM) , and 1 to bla (GES.) Of the total reports, 126 analyzed
      Acinetobacter baumannii: 55 corresponded to bla (OXA-23) , 66 to bla
      (OXA-24) , 3 to bla (NDM,) and 2 to bla (OXA-143) . CONCLUSIONS: There is
      a limited number of publications about carbapenemases among patients in
      Peru. The genotype reports come primarily from hospitals in the country's
      capital. This is the first review that aims to identify the types of
      carbapenemases reported in enterobacteria, P. aeruginosa, and A. baummani.

AB  - Sink waste traps and drains are a reservoir for multi-drug resistant
      Gram-negative bacteria in the hospital environment. It has been suggested
      that these bacteria can migrate through hospital plumbing. Hospital waste
      traps were installed in a laboratory model system where sinks were
      connected through a common wastewater pipe. Enterobacterales populations
      were monitored using selective culture, MALDI-TOF identification and
      antibiotic resistance profiling before and after a wastewater backflow
      event. When transfer between sinks was suspected, isolates were compared
      using whole-genome sequencing. Immediately after the wastewater backflow,
      two KPC-producing Enterobacter cloacae were recovered from a waste trap in
      which Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) had not been detected
      previously. The isolates belonged to ST501 and ST31 and were genetically
      indistinguishable to those colonising sinks elsewhere in the system.
      Following inter-sink transfer, KPC-producing E. cloacae ST501 successfully
      integrated into the microbiome of the recipient sink and was detected in
      the waste trap water at least five months after the backflow event. Seven
      weeks and three months after the backflow, other inter-sink transfers
      involving Escherichia coli ST5295 and KPC-producing E. cloacae ST501 were
      also observed.

      Isolates of Escherichia coli (n = 335), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 316;
      144 isolates with hyperviscosity characteristics), Pseudomonas aeruginosa
      (n = 271), Acinetobacter baumannii complex (n = 187), and non-typhoidal
      Salmonella species (n = 226), Shigella species (n = 13) from miscellaneous

      to test antibiotics were determined using the broth microdilution method.
      GeneXpert was used to detect genes encoding carbapenemases among the
      carbapenem-non-susceptible (NS) Enterobacterales isolates. RESULTS: The
      MIC values of the cefepime-enmetazobactam combination against
      extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates
      (MIC(90) ≤ 0.5 mg/L), bla(KPC)-harboring E. coli isolates (0.25 mg/L; n =
      2), and 80% of bla(OXA-48)-like gene-harboring K. pneumoniae isolates (≤2
      mg/L) were low. The MIC ranges of the cefepime-zidebactam against
      carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales isolates (irrespective of the
      carbapenemase type [MIC(90) ≤ 4 mg/L]) and carbapenem-NS or
      ceftolozane-tazobactam-NS P. aeruginosa isolates (MIC(90) value, 8 mg/L)
      were significantly lower than those of the cefepime-enmetazobactam.
      CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy of novel antibiotics against important
      drug-resistant GNB must be monitored and validated during the clinical
      treatment of patients.

AB  - Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) infection poses a great
      threat to public health worldwide, and KPC-2-producing strains are the
      main factors responsible for resistance to carbapenems in China.
      Ceftazidime/avibactam (CZA) is a novel β-lactam/β-lactamase inhibitor
      combination with good activity against KPC-2 carbapenemase and is becoming
      the most important option for treating KPC-producing CRKP infection. Here,
      we report the emergence of a novel KPC-2 variant, designated KPC-74,
      produced by K. pneumoniae strain KP55, that conferred CZA resistance in a
      patient after CZA exposure. The novel bla (KPC-74) variant showed a
      deletion of 6 nucleotides at positions 712-717 compared with bla (KPC-2),
      and this deletion resulted in the consequent deletion of glycine and
      valine at positions 239 and 240. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing
      showed that KP55 presents multidrug resistance, including resistance to
      CZA and ertapenem, but is susceptible to imipenem, meropenem, and
      colistin. The bla (KPC-74) gene was located on a plasmid, as determined by
      S1-nuclease pulsed-field gel electrophoresis followed by southern
      blotting, and confirmed to be 133,766 bp in length by whole-genome
      sequencing on both the Illumina and MinION platforms. The CZA resistance
      phenotype of the novel KPC variant was confirmed by both transformation of
      the bla (KPC-74)-harboring plasmid and a bla (KPC-74) gene cloning assay,
      showing a 64-fold higher CZA minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) than
      the recipient strains. The G239_V240del observed in KPC-74 was outside the
      omega-loop region but was still close to the active site Ser70 and
      omega-loop in the protein tertiary structure. The enzyme kinetic
      parameters and IC(50) values further indicated that the hydrolytic
      activity of the KPC-74 enzyme against ceftazidime was potentiated twofold
      and that the affinity between KPC-74 and avibactam was alleviated 17-fold
      compared with that of the KPC-2 allele. This CZA resistance mediated by
      KPC-74 could be selected after CZA therapy and evolved to be more diverse
      and heterogeneous. Surveillance of CZA resistance is urgently needed in
      clinical settings.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study retrospectively analyzed the genome characteristics of
      blaKPC-2 in multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae collected from the
      ICU of a teaching hospital in Shanghai, China. METHODS: From February 2018
      to December 2019, 36 strains of multidrug-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae
      were collected from the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid of critically ill
      patients. The genome of all isolates was obtained through the Illumina
      sequence, and single nucleotide polymorphisms of the blaKPC-2 gene were
      analyzed to explore blaKPC-2's evolutionary characteristics. Different
      strains' genetic relationships and homology were studied by constructing
      an evolutionary tree on a single copy orthologue. Pacbio combined Illumina
      sequence was conducted to evaluate the structure and potential mobility of
      drug-resistant plasmids of the strain KP-s26. RESULTS: The distribution of
      resistance and virulence genes had little difference, but most strains had
      significant differences in the plasmid-encoded region. Most strains
      (31/36) carried the carbapenemase gene blaKPC-2, with no single nucleotide
      polymorphism in different strains. Extended-spectrum β-lactamase
      resistance genes, such as blaCTX-M and blaSHV, were found in the isolates,
      but no metallo-β-lactamases were detected. All strains with blaKPC-2
      coexisted with chromosomal-associated fosfomycin resistance genes fosA6,
      and the coexistence of blaKPC-2 and blaCTX variants (blaCTX-M-15,
      blaCTX-M-65, and blaCTX-M-27) was also detected in 29/31 strains. The
      isolate KP-s26 carried five circular plasmids. pA and pB were conjugate
      plasmids, as they carried drug resistance genes and contained a complete
      IV secretion system. CONCLUSION: The blaKPC-2 carbapenemase gene is
      relatively conservative in the process of evolution; drug-resistant
      plasmids containing conjugated transfer elements contribute to the
      spreading of drug resistance. The coexistence of blaKPC-2 with fosA6 or
      blaCTX-M variants was associated with increased fosfomycin resistance and
      broad-spectrum β-lactam resistance, respectively. CLINICAL TRIALS

AB  - Carbapenem-resistant (CR) Klebsiella pneumoniae represents an urgent
      worldwide threat. We focused on CR K. pneumoniae in selected facilities of
      the University Hospital Bratislava (UHB) to investigate sequence types
      (STs), clonal relatedness, and antimicrobial resistance. Suspected
      carbapenem-nonsusceptible K. pneumoniae strains were obtained from
      hospitalized patients. Further examination included carbapenemase
      confirmation, cgMLST, and quantitative susceptibility testing. Of the
      total 41 CR K. pneumoniae strains, 26 (63.4%) were determined as ST11 in
      hospital No. 1; of these ST11, 22 (84.6%) were found in the first internal
      clinic. Six (14.6%) ST258 and three (7.3%) ST584 occurred in hospital No.
      2; the most, i.e., four (66.7%), ST258 were detected in the geriatric
      clinic. In hospital No. 3, we found two (4.8%) ST584 and one (2.4%) ST258.
      Of the ST11 set, 24 (92.3%) produced NDM-1. Furthermore, seven (87.5)
      ST258 and five (100%) ST584 strains generated KPC-2. Antimicrobial
      resistance was as follows: ertapenem 97.6%, meropenem 63.4%, tigecycline
      7.3%, eravacycline 7.3%, and colistin 2.5%. We revealed a presumably
      epidemiological association of ST11 with transmission, particularly in the
      first internal clinic of hospital No. 1, while ST258 and ST584 were
      related to interhospital dissemination between medical facilities No. 2
      and No. 3. It is essential to prevent the circulation of these pathogens
      within and between healthcare facilities.

AB  - Novel β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor combinations currently approved for
      clinical use are poorly active against metallo-β-lactamase (MBL)-producing
      strains. We evaluated the in vitro activity of cefepime-taniborbactam (FTB
      [formerly cefepime-VNRX-5133]) and comparator agents against
      carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (n = 247) and
      carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas species (n = 170) clinical isolates
      prospectively collected from different clinical origins in patients
      admitted to 8 Spanish hospitals. FTB was the most active agent in both
      Enterobacterales (97.6% MIC(FTB), ≤8/4 mg/L) and Pseudomonas (67.1%
      MIC(FTB), ≤8/4 mg/L) populations. The MIC(FTB) was >8 mg/L in 6/247 (2.4%)
      Enterobacterales isolates (3 KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates,
      1 VIM-producing Enterobacter cloacae isolate, 1 IMP-producing E. cloacae
      isolate, and 1 NDM-producing Escherichia coli isolate) and in 56/170
      (32.9%) Pseudomonas isolates, 19 of them carbapenemase producers (15
      producers of VIM, 2 of GES, 1 of GES+VIM, and 1 of GES+KPC). Against the
      Enterobacterales isolates with meropenem MICs of >2 mg/L (138/247), FTB
      was the most active agent against both serine-β-lactamases (107/138) and
      MBL producers (31/138) (97.2 and 93.5% MIC(FTB), ≤8/4 mg/L, respectively),
      whereas the activity of comparators was reduced, particularly against the
      MBL producers (ceftazidime-avibactam, 94.4 and 12.9%,
      meropenem-vaborbactam, 85.0 and 64.5%, imipenem-relebactam, 76.6 and 9.7%,
      ceftolozane-tazobactam, 1.9 and 0%, and piperacillin-tazobactam, 0 and 0%,
      respectively). Among the meropenem-resistant Pseudomonas isolates
      (163/170; MIC, >2 mg/L), the activities of FTB against serine-β-lactamase
      (35/163) and MBL (43/163) producers were 88.6 and 65.1%, respectively,
      whereas the susceptibilities of comparators were as follows:
      ceftazidime-avibactam, 88.5 and 16.0%, meropenem-vaborbactam, 8.5 and
      7.0%, imipenem-relebactam, 2.9 and 2.3%, ceftolozane-tazobactam, 0 and
      2.3%, and piperacillin-tazobactam, 0 and 0%, respectively. Microbiological
      results suggest FTB as a potential therapeutic option in patients infected
      with carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales and carbapenem-resistant
      Pseudomonas isolates, including MBL producers.

TI  - The Rate of Acquisition of Carbapenemase-Producing Enterobacteriaceae
      among Close Contact Patients Depending on Carbapenemase Enzymes

AB  - BACKGROUND: Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) are highly
      drug-resistant pathogens. Screening the contacts of newly-identified CPE
      patients is crucial for nosocomial transmission control. We evaluated the
      acquisition rate of CPE in close contacts as a function of CPE genotype.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study was conducted in Asan Medical Center, a
      2,700-bed, tertiary teaching hospital in Seoul, Korea, between November
      2010 and October 2017. Index cases were defined as patients with positive
      tests for CPE from any infected or colonized site during hospitalization
      who had no direct epidemiologic linkage with existing CPE patients; close
      contact patients were defined as those whose hospital stay overlapped with
      the stay of an index case for at least one day and who occupied the same
      room or intensive care unit (ICU). Secondary patients were defined as
      those who produced positive CPE culture isolates from surveillance
      cultures that had the same CPE enzyme as that of the index case patients.
      RESULTS: A total of 211 index case patients and 2,689 corresponding
      contact patients were identified. Of the contact patients, 1,369 (50.9%)
      including 649 New-Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase-1 (NDM-1) and 448
      Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing CPE exposures were
      screened, and 44 secondary patients (3.2%; 95% confidence interval 2.3 -
      4.3%) were positive for NDM-1-producing CPE (16 patients) and
      KPC-producing (24 patients) CPE. The CPE acquisition rate (5.4%) for
      KPC-producing CPE exposures was significantly higher than that for NDM-1
      exposures (2.7%) (P = 0.01). CONCLUSION: The CPE acquisition rate was 3.2%
      among close contacts sharing a multi-patient room, with about a two-fold
      higher risk of KPC-producing CPE than NDM-1-producing CPE.

AB  - Hospital-acquired bloodstream infections are a severe worldwide problem
      associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This retrospective,
      single-center study aimed to analyze bloodstream infections in patients
      hospitalized in the intensive care unit of the Military Institute of
      Medicine, Poland. Data from the years 2007-2019 were analyzed. When the
      infection was suspected, blood samples were drawn and analyzed
      microbiologically. When bacterial growth was observed, an antimicrobial
      susceptibility/resistance analysis was performed. Among 12,619 analyzed
      samples, 1,509 were positive, and 1,557 pathogens were isolated. In
      278/1,509 of the positive cases, a central line catheter infection was
      confirmed. Gram-negative bacteria were the most frequently (770/1,557)
      isolated, including Acinetobacter baumannii (312/770), Klebsiella
      pneumoniae (165/770; 67/165 were the isolates that expressed extended
      spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL), 5/165 isolates produced the New Delhi
      metallo-β-lactamases (NDM), 4/165 isolates expressed Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenemase (KPC), and 1/165 isolate produced OXA48 carbapenemase),
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa (111/770; 2/111 isolates produced
      metallo-β-lactamase (MBL), and Escherichia coli (69/770; 11/69 - ESBL).
      Most Gram-positive pathogens were staphylococci (545/733), mainly
      coagulase-negative (368/545). Among 545 isolates of the staphylococci, 58
      represented methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Fungi were
      isolated from 3.5% of samples. All isolated MRSA and methicillin-resistant
      coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (MRCNS) strains were susceptible to
      vancomycin, methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) isolates -
      to isoxazolyl penicillins, and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) -
      to linezolid and tigecycline. However, colistin was the only therapeutic
      option in some infections caused by A. baumannii and KPC-producing K.
      pneumoniae. P. aeruginosa was still susceptible to cefepime and
      ceftazidime. Echinocandins were effective therapeutics in the treatment of
      fungal infections.

AB  - The emergence of strains resistant to certain antibiotics is turning into
      an important issue worldwide that threatens global health with the
      increasing incidence of carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae
      (KPC). Thus, successful doripenem-ertapenem (DOR-ERTA) combination is
      highly recommended in treatment of bacteremic ventilator-associated
      pneumonia due to Klebsiella pneumoniae. Hence, a fast and highly-sensitive
      HPLC-UV method was developed for the estimation of the cited drugs
      simultaneously in their pure form, pharmaceutical dosage forms and in
      simulated synthetic mixtures. The DOR-ERTA mixture was successfully
      separated within 6 min on a reversed-phase ODS column using an isocratic
      elution; a mobile phase mixture consists of 0.05 M phosphate buffer (pH
      3.0 adjusted by 85% ortho-phosphoric acid) : acetonitrile : methanol (86 :
      12 : 2; % v/v/v). The proposed method was optimized and validated
      according to ICH guidelines, where the calibration graph was constructed
      from 0.04 to 50 μg mL(-1) and from 0.05 to 50 μg mL(-1) with low detection
      limits reached 1.7 and 1.4 ng mL(-1) for DOR and ERTA respectively. The
      proposed method showed higher sensitivity than several previous methods,
      which allowed an effective estimation of the DOR and ERTA in human plasma
      after a simple extraction method with high recovery results ranged from
      96.30% ± 1.55 to 97.90% ± 1.45 and without any interference from plasma
      components.

AB  - While antibiotic resistance is rising to dangerously high levels,
      resistance mechanisms are spreading globally among diverse bacterial
      species. The emergence of antibiotic-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae,
      mainly due to the production of antibiotic-inactivating enzymes, is
      currently responsible for most treatment failures, threatening the
      effectiveness of classes of antibiotics used for decades. This study
      assessed the presence of genetic determinants of β-lactam resistance in
      102 multi-drug resistant (MDR) K. pneumoniae isolates from patients
      admitted to two central hospitals in northern Portugal from 2010 to 2020.
      Antimicrobial susceptibility testing revealed a high rate (>90%) of
      resistance to most β-lactam antibiotics, except for carbapenems and
      cephamycins, which showed antimicrobial susceptibility rates in the range
      of 23.5-34.3% and 40.2-68.6%, respectively. A diverse pool of β-lactam
      resistance genetic determinants, including carbapenemases- (i.e.,
      bla(KPC-like) and bla(OXA-48-like)), extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL;
      i.e., bla(TEM-like), bla(CTX-M-like) and bla(SHV-like)), and AmpC
      β-lactamases-coding genes (i.e., bla(CMY-2-like) and bla(DHA-like)) were
      found in most K. pneumoniae isolates. bla(KPC-like) (72.5%) and ESBL genes
      (37.3-74.5%) were the most detected, with approximately 80% of K.
      pneumoniae isolates presenting two or more resistance genes. As the
      optimal treatment of β-lactamase-producing K. pneumoniae infections
      remains problematic, the high co-occurrence of multiple β-lactam
      resistance genes must be seen as a serious warning of the problem of
      antimicrobial resistance.

      (BSI) is currently unavailable. This study aimed to identify the
      appropriate antibiotics and the risk factors of all-cause mortality for
      CRKP BSI patients. This retrospective cohort study included the
      hospitalized patients with CRKP BSI. Primary outcome was 30-day all-cause
      mortality. Cox regression analysis was used to evaluate the risk factors
      of 30-day mortality. A total of 89 patients were included with a 30-day
      mortality of 52.1%. A total of 52 (58.4%) patients were treated with
      appropriate antimicrobial regimens and 58 (65.2%) isolates carried
      bla(KPC-2) genes. Microbiologic eradication within 7 days (adjusted hazard
      ratio [HR] = 0.09, p 7 days, lower platelet count, and a higher Pitt
      bacteremia score. These findings render a new insight into the clinical
      landscape of CRKP BSI.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Triple-action diazabicyclooctanes, e.g. zidebactam, combine
      β-lactamase inhibition, antibacterial activity, and 'enhancement' of
      PBP3-targeted β-lactams. OBJECTIVES: To examine the activity of
      cefepime/zidebactam against consecutive 'problem' Gram-negative bacteria
      referred to the UK national reference laboratory. METHODS: MICs were
      determined by BSAC agar dilution for 1632 Enterobacterales, 745
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 450 other non-fermenters, categorized by
      carbapenemase detection and interpretive reading. RESULTS: Universal
      susceptibility to cefepime/zidebactam 8 + 8 mg/L was seen for otherwise
      multidrug-resistant Enterobacterales with AmpC, extended-spectrum, K1, KPC
      and OXA-48-like β-lactamases, or with impermeability and 'unassigned'
      mechanisms. Unlike ceftazidime/avibactam and all other comparators,
      cefepime/zidebactam 8 + 8 mg/L also inhibited most (190/210, 90.5%)
      Enterobacterales with MBLs. Resistance in the remaining minority of MBL
      producers, and in 13/24 with both NDM MBLs and OXA-48-like enzymes, was
      associated with Klebsiella pneumoniae ST14. For Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
      MICs of cefepime/zidebactam rose with efflux grade, but exceeded 8 + 8
      mg/L for only 11/85 isolates even in the highly-raised efflux group. Among
      103 P. aeruginosa with ESBLs or MBLs, 97 (94.5%) were inhibited by
      cefepime/zidebactam 8 + 8 mg/L whereas fewer than 15% were susceptible to
      any comparator. MICs for Acinetobacter baumannii with acquired OXA
      carbapenemases clustered around 8 + 8 to 32 + 32 mg/L, with higher values
      for MBL producers. A strong enhancer effect augmented activity against
      many isolates that were highly resistant to cefepime and zidebactam alone
      and which had mechanisms not inhibited by zidebactam. CONCLUSIONS:
      Assuming successful clinical trials, cefepime/zidebactam has scope to
      widely overcome critical resistances in both Enterobacterales and
      non-fermenters.

AB  - Carbapenemase-KPC producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (CP-Kp) infection
      represents a serious threat to solid organ transplant (SOT). All patients
      admitted between 1 May 2011 and 31 August 2014 undergoing SOT were
      included in the retrospective study. The primary outcomes included a
      description of the association of enteric colonization and invasive
      infections by CP-Kp with one-year mortality. Secondary outcomes were the
      study of risk factors for colonization and invasive infections by CP-Kp.
      Results: A total of 5.4% (45/828) of SOT recipients had at least one
      positive rectal swab for CP-Kp, with most (88.9%) occurring after
      transplantation. 4.5% (35/828) of patients developed a CP-Kp-related
      invasive infection, with 68.6% (24/35) being previously colonized. The
      1-year mortality was 31.1% in patients with enteric colonization with
      CP-Kp and, it was 51.4% among patients with CP-Kp-related invasive
      infections. At univariate analysis, colonization, invasive infections,
      sepsis, severe sepsis, and septic shock were significantly associated with
      1-year mortality. At multivariate analysis, only invasive infections and
      the combination of sepsis, severe sepsis, or septic shock were
      significantly associated with 1-year mortality, whereas gastrointestinal
      colonization was significantly associated with survival. In this
      population, the 1-year mortality was significantly associated with
      invasive infections; otherwise, gastrointestinal colonization was not
      associated with increased 1-year mortality.

TI  - A novel KPC-113 variant conferring carbapenem and ceftazidime-avibactam
      resistance in a multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolate
T2  - Clin Microbiol Infect
PY  - 2022

CY  - England
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to characterize a novel KPC-113 variant from
      a clinical Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolate R20-14. METHODS: Genomic DNA of
      R20-14 was subjected to Illumina and Oxford Nanopore sequencing. The
      horizontal transmission of plasmid was evaluated with conjugation
      experiments. Minimum inhibitory concentrations of bacterial strains were
      obtained using broth microdilution methods. KPC-113 detectability of
      different carbapenemase detection methods was tested. The kinetic
      parameters of KPC-113 were compared with those of KPC-2 by a
      spectrophotometer. Structure modelling and molecular docking of KPC-2 and
      KPC-113 were performed using Schrödinger. RESULTS: R20-14, a sequence type
      3903 multidrug-resistant strain, was resistant to carbapenems and
      ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA) concurrently. S1-nuclease pulsed-field gel
      electrophoresis and genomic analysis revealed a bla(KPC-113)-carrying
      plasmid pR20-14, which resembled the previously reported type I
      KPC-encoding P. aeruginosa plasmids and exhibited a high conjugation
      frequency. KPC-113, with a glycine residue insertion between Ambler
      positions 266 and 267 in KPC-2, conferred both carbapenem and CZA
      resistance in DH5α and PAO1 transformants. Diagnostic tests showed that
      KPC-113 acted in a similar manner to KPC-2. Compared with KPC-2, KPC-113
      presented reduced catalytic ability to carbapenems and ceftazidime,
      meanwhile responding poorly to avibactam inhibition. Modelling structure
      revealed that KPC-113 possibly had a more flattened binding pocket than
      KPC-2, leading to the change of ligand binding modes. CONCLUSIONS: KPC-113
      is a novel KPC variant mediating both CZA resistance and carbapenem
      resistance. It is of great concern that bla(KPC-113) could transfer
      horizontally with great efficiency and inactivate carbapenems and CZA
      simultaneously. Great efforts should be made to prevent its spread in
      clinical settings.

TI  - A multispecies outbreak of carbapenem-resistant bacteria harboring the
      bla(KPC) gene in a non-classical transposon element

CY  - England
AB  - BACKGROUND: Klebsiella pneumoniae is the most frequent KPC-producing
      bacteria. The bla(KPC) gene is frequently embedded in Tn4401 transposon,
      and less frequently in non-Tn4401 elements (NTE(KPC)) variants I-III. The
      first case of KPC in the UC-CHRISTUS Clinical Hospital was detected in
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Soon after this event, KPC was detected in 2
      additional Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 3 Escherichia coli, 3 Enterobacter
      cloacae, 3 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1 Citrobacter freundii, isolated
      from 6 different patients. We aimed to elucidate the possible mechanisms
      of genetic transfer and dissemination of the bla(KPC) gene among isolates
      of this multispecies outbreak. A molecular epidemiology analysis of the
      above mentioned clinical isolates (n = 13) through Multi-Locus Sequence
      Typing, plasmid analysis, Pulsed-Field Gel-Electrophoresis, and
      Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed. RESULTS: High-risk sequence
      types were found: K. pneumoniae ST11, P. aeruginosa ST654, and E. cloacae
      ST114. All enterobacterial isolates were not clonal except for 3 E. coli
      isolated from the same patient. WGS analysis in 6 enterobacterial isolates
      showed that 4 of them had bla(KPC) embedded in a novel variant of NTE(KPC)
      designated NTE(KPC)-IIe. Upstream of bla(KPC) gene there was a 570 pb
      truncated bla(TEM-1) gene followed by an insertion sequence that was 84%
      similar to ISEc63, a 4473 bp element of the Tn3 family. Downstream the
      bla(KPC) gene there was a truncated ISKpn6 gene, and the inverted repeat
      right sequence of Tn4401. The ISec63-like element together with the
      bla(KPC) gene plus Tn4401 remnants were inserted in the Tra operon
      involved in conjugative transfer of the plasmid. This NTE was carried in a
      broad host-range IncN plasmid. P. aeruginosa isolates carried bla(KPC)
      gene embedded in a typical Tn4401b transposon in a different plasmid,
      suggesting that there was no plasmid transfer between Enterobacteriaceae
      and P. aeruginosa as initially hypothesized. CONCLUSIONS: Most
      enterobacterial isolates had bla(KPC) embedded in the same NTE(KPC)-IIe
      element, suggesting that this multispecies KPC outbreak was due to
      horizontal gene transfer rather than clonal spread. This poses a greater
      challenge to infection control measures often directed against containment
      of clonal spread.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to evaluate the in vitro activity of
      meropenem-vaborbactam (MVB) against a collection of carbapenem-resistant
      Escherichia coli (CREC) isolates and to compare the activity with other
      antibiotics with regard to different separation sites,
      carbapenem-resistant mechanisms, and sequence types (STs). METHODS: A
      total of 58 CREC strains were used as the experimental strains from the
      First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University in southeastern
      China. The minimum inhibitory concentrations of MVB,
      ceftazidime-avibactam, and tigecycline against all the experimental
      strains were determined by the microdilution broth method. RESULTS: MVB
      exhibited higher antimicrobial activity (83% susceptibility) than that of
      other antibiotics, except for colistin and tigecycline. The susceptibility
      of CREC strains towards MVB varied with regard to carbapenem-resistant
      mechanisms and STs, especially in Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase
      (KPC)-positive isolates and ST8 isolates. CONCLUSION: MVB exhibited
      considerably high activity against KPC-producing and ST8 CREC isolates. It
      has the great potential to be an alternative for the treatment of
      infections caused by CREC after determining the type of carbapenemase, the
      susceptibility to MVB and/or STs.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) belongs to the
      Group-A β-lactamases that incorporate serine at their active site and
      hydrolyze various penicillins, cephalosporins, and carbapenems.
      Metallo-beta-lactamases (MBLs) are group-B enzymes that contain one or two
      essential zinc ions in the active sites and hydrolyze almost all
      clinically available β-lactam antibiotics. Klebsiella pneumoniae remains
      the pathogen with the most antimicrobial resistance to KPC and MBLs.
      METHODS: This research investigated the blaKPC, and MBL genes, namely,
      blaIMP, blaVIM, and blaNDM-1 and their phenotypic resistance to K.
      pneumoniae isolated from urinary tract infections (UTI) in Bangladesh.
      Isolated UTI K. pneumoniae were identified by API-20E and 16s rDNA gene
      analysis. Their phenotypic antimicrobial resistance was examined by the
      Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method, followed by minimal inhibitory
      concentration (MIC) determination. blaKPC, blaIMP, blaNDM-1, and blaVIM
      genes were evaluated by polymerase chain reactions (PCR) and confirmed by
      sequencing. RESULTS: Fifty-eight K. pneumoniae were identified from 142
      acute UTI cases. Their phenotypic resistance to amoxycillin-clavulanic
      acid, cephalexin, cefuroxime, ceftriaxone, and imipenem were 98.3%, 100%,
      96.5%, 91.4%, 75.1%, respectively. Over half (31/58) of the isolates
      contained either blaKPC or one of the MBL genes. Individual prevalence of
      blaKPC, blaIMP, blaNDM-1, and blaVIM were 15.5% (9), 10.3% (6), 22.4%
      (13), and 19% (11), respectively. Of these, eight isolates (25.8%, 8/31)
      were found to have two genes in four different combinations. The
      co-existence of the ESBL genes generated more resistance than each one
      individually. Some isolates appeared phenotypically susceptible to
      imipenem in the presence of blaKPC, blaIMP, blaVIM, and blaNDM-1 genes,
      singly or in combination. CONCLUSION: The discrepancy of genotype and
      phenotype resistance has significant consequences for clinical
      bacteriology, precision in diagnosis, the prudent selection of
      antimicrobials, and rational prescribing. Heterogeneous phenotypes of
      antimicrobial susceptibility testing should be taken seriously to avoid
      inappropriate diagnostic and therapeutic decisions.

AB  - In a previous work, we demonstrated that nasally administered
      Corynebacterium pseudodiphtheriticum 090104 beneficially modulated the
      respiratory innate immune response and improved the protection against
      Respiratory Syncytial Virus and Streptococcus pneumoniae in mice. In this
      work, we aimed to evaluate whether the immunomodulatory 090104 strain was
      able to enhance the resistance against the respiratory infection induced
      by hypermucoviscous carbapenemase-producing (KPC-2) Klebsiella pneumoniae
      strains belonging to the sequence type (ST) 25. The nasal treatment of
      mice with C. pseudodiphtheriticum 090104 before the challenge with
      multiresistant K. pneumoniae ST25 strains significantly reduced lung
      bacterial cell counts and lung tissue damage. The protective effect of the
      090104 strain was related to its ability to regulate the respiratory
      innate immune response triggered by K. pneumoniae challenge. C.
      pseudifteriticum 090104 differentially modulated the recruitment of
      leukocytes into the lung and the production of TNF-α, IFN-γ and IL-10
      levels in the respiratory tract and serum. Our results make an advance in
      the positioning of C. pseudodiphtheriticum 090104 as a next-generation
      probiotic for the respiratory tract and encourage further research of this
      bacterium as a promising alternative to develop non-antibiotic
      therapeutical approaches to enhance the prevention of infections produced
      by microorganisms with multiple resistance to antimicrobials such as
      KPC-2-producing hypermucoviscous K. pneumoniae strains belonging to ST25.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Vaborem is a fixed dose combination of vaborbactam and
      meropenem with potent activity against target Carbapenem-resistant
      Enterobacterales (CRE) pathogens, optimally developed for Klebsiella
      pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC). The study aims to evaluate the
      cost-effectiveness of Vaborem versus best available therapy (BAT) for the
      treatment of patients with CRE-KPC associated infections in the Italian
      setting. METHODS: A cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted based on a
      decision tree model that simulates the clinical pathway followed by
      physicians treating patients with a confirmed CRE-KPC infection in a
      5-year time horizon. The Italian National Health System perspective was
      adopted with a 3% discount rate. The clinical inputs were mostly sourced
      from the phase 3, randomised, clinical trial (TANGO II). Unit costs were
      retrieved from the Italian official drug pricing list and legislation,
      while patient resource use was validated by a national expert. Model
      outcomes included life years (LYs) and quality adjusted life years (QALYs)
      gained, incremental costs, incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) and
      incremental cost-utility ratio (ICUR). Deterministic and probabilistic
      sensitivity analyses were also performed. RESULTS: Vaborem is expected to
      decrease the burden associated with treatment failure and reduce the need
      for chronic renal replacement therapy while costs related to drug
      acquisition and long-term care (due to higher survival) may increase.
      Treatment with Vaborem versus BAT leads to a gain of 0.475 LYs, 0.384
      QALYs, and incremental costs of €3549, resulting in an ICER and ICUR of
      €7473/LY and €9246/QALY, respectively. Sensitivity analyses proved the
      robustness of the model and also revealed that the probability of Vaborem
      being cost-effective reaches 90% when willingness to pay is €15,850/QALY.
      CONCLUSIONS: In the Italian setting, the introduction of Vaborem will lead
      to a substantial increase in the quality of life together with a minimal
      cost impact, therefore Vaborem is expected to be a cost-effective strategy
      compared to BAT.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of
      CHROMagar™ KPC compared with Xpert® Carba-R assay for the detection of
      carbapenem-resistant bacterial isolates from rectal swabs. METHODS: Rectal
      swabs were obtained from patients admitted to Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi
      (United Arab Emirates) over a period of 7 months and were screened for
      carbapenem resistance by either culture on CHROMagar KPC or carbapenemase
      production using the Xpert Carba-R molecular method. Further testing for
      carbapenem susceptibility of isolates recovered from CHROMagar KPC was
      performed using VITEK®2. RESULTS: A total of 1813 rectal swabs were
      screened, of which 61 (3.4%) were positive for carbapenem resistance by
      either one or both methods. Both methods were equally efficient in
      detecting carbapenem resistance in 37/61 swabs (60.7%), mostly positive
      for Klebsiella pneumoniae (22 isolates), of which 40.9% (9/22) carried
      bla(OXA-48-like) and bla(NDM). Xpert Carba-R assay detected 12 additional
      swabs with negative CHROMagar KPC culture and revealed additional
      carbapenemase-producing organisms carrying bla(OXA-48-like) and/or
      bla(NDM). CHROMagar KPC recovered organisms in nine swabs not detected by
      the genotypic method, 44.4% of which were K. pneumoniae. Three swabs
      yielded false-positive results (carbapenem-susceptible organisms) by both
      methods. Sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 75.4% and 99.8%
      for CHROMagar KPC and 80% and 99.8% for Xpert Carba-R. CONCLUSION: This
      comparative study of CHROMagar KPC versus Xpert Carba-R in rectal swabs
      showed a slightly higher sensitivity for the PCR-based method. Whilst
      CHROMagar KPC provides a less expensive screening method, Xpert Carba-R
      may be more accurate and faster.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergence of polymyxin B resistance among
      carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) causes clinical
      treatment to be more difficult. We aimed to investigate the risk factors
      and resistance mechanisms in the polymyxin resistant CRKP (PR-CRKP)
      strains. METHODS: From January 2021 to January 2022, 239 CRKP strains were
      selected, all of which were analyzed using antimicrobial susceptibility
      testing and clinical data. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed
      for the detection of resistance genes. RT-qPCR was used to quantify
      transcriptional levels of polymyxin resistance genes. Risk factors for
      polymyxin B resistant isolates were identified by logistic regression
      analysis. RESULTS: The resistance rate of polymyxin B was 5.02%. In all
      CRKP strains, 41.84% came from the ICU. The percentage of carbapenemase
      producing strains was 93.72%. The main carbapenem resistance gene was
      bla(KPC) (90.79%). In the 12 strains of PR-CRKP screened, pmrB and pmrK
      were overexpressed in all samples which were linked with polymyxin B
      resistance. Multivariate analysis showed that coronary heart disease may
      be an independent risk factor predisposing patients to polymyxin B
      resistance. CONCLUSION: We determine the multifaceted mechanism and risk
      factors of polymyxin B resistance in CRKP. Polymyxin resistance is a
      complex and changing problem, and more research is required.

AB  - The role of β-lactamases in reduced susceptibility or resistance to
      cefiderocol has been supported by recent reports. The purpose of this
      study was to investigate the in vitro impact of clinically available
      β-lactamase inhibitors on cefiderocol activity against characterized
      carbapenemase-producing Gram-negative isolates. A collection of 39
      well-characterized Gram-negative isolates obtained from various clinical
      sources and countries were included. Cefiderocol antimicrobial
      susceptibility was evaluated via reference broth microdilution. The
      chequerboard microdilution method and time-kill assays were used to
      determine the synergy of tazobactam, avibactam, vaborbactam and relebactam
      in combination with cefiderocol. MICs of cefiderocol presented a 4- to
      256-fold reduction against Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase
      (KPC)-producing Gram-negative isolates (predominantly K. pneumoniae) when
      avibactam, vaborbactam and relebactam were combined individually. Notably,
      the KPC-inhibitors led to a 4- to 32-fold reduction in cefiderocol MICs in
      the four cefiderocol-resistant KPC-producing K. pneumoniae isolates,
      showing restoration of cefiderocol susceptibility (MIC ≤ 2 mg/L) in ten
      out of twelve cases. Tazobactam led to a 4- to 64-fold decrease in
      cefiderocol MICs only in K. pneumoniae strains harbouring bla(KPC-41),
      bla(KPC-31), bla(KPC-53) and bla(KPC-66). The synergistic effect of all
      serine-β-lactamase inhibitors on cefiderocol activity was also shown in
      OXA-48-like-producing Enterobacterales strains. Conversely, a combination
      of β-lactamases inhibitors with cefiderocol was not synergistic with all
      OXA-23-like-producing strains and most metallo-β-lactamases producers. In
      conclusion, the addition of clinically available serine β-lactamase
      inhibitors to cefiderocol might represent an important development in the
      formulation to increase its spectrum and therapeutic efficacy, and to
      limit in vivo resistance emergence.

AB  - The usefulness of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) was proven during
      the COVID-19 pandemic, and the role of environmental monitoring of
      emerging infectious diseases has been recognized. In this study, the
      prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) in Japanese
      environmental samples was measured in the context of applying WBE to CRE.
      A total of 247 carbapenem-resistant isolates were obtained from
      wastewater, treated wastewater, and river water. Treated wastewater was
      shown to be an efficient target for monitoring CRE. The results of the
      isolate analysis showed that WBE may be applicable to Escherichia
      coli-carrying New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM)-type carbapenemase, the
      Enterobacter cloacae complex and Klebsiella pneumoniae complex-carrying
      IMP-type carbapenemase. In addition, a certain number of CRE isolated in
      this study carried Guiana extended spectrum (GES)-type carbapenemase
      although their clinical importance was unclear. Only a few isolates of
      Klebsiella aerogenes were obtained from environmental samples in spite of
      their frequent detection in clinical isolates. Neither the KPC-type, the
      oxacillinase (OXA)-type nor the VIM-type of carbapenemase was detected in
      the CRE, which reflected a low regional prevalence. These results
      indicated the expectation and the limitation of applying WBE to CRE.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa
      (KPC-PA) has been reported sporadically. However, epidemiological and
      antimicrobial susceptibility data specific for KPC-PA are lacking. We
      collected 374 carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (CRPA) isolates from
      seven hospitals in China from June 2016 to February 2019 and identified
      the bla(KPC-2) gene in 40.4% (n = 151/374) of the isolates. Approximately
      one-half of all KPC-PA isolates (n = 76/151; 50.3%) were resistant to
      ceftazidime-avibactam (CAZ-AVI). Combining Kraken2 taxonomy identification
      and Nanopore sequencing, we identified eight plasmid types, five of which
      carried bla(KPC-2), and 13 combination patterns of these plasmid types. In
      addition, we identified IS26-ΔTn6296 and Tn1403-like-ΔTn6296 as the two
      mobile genetic elements that mediated bla(KPC-2) transmission. bla(KPC-2)
      plasmid curing in 28 strains restored CAZ-AVI susceptibility, suggesting
      that bla(KPC-2) was the mediator of CAZ-AVI resistance. Furthermore, the
      bla(KPC-2) copy number was found to correlate with KPC expression and,
      therefore, CAZ-AVI resistance. Taken together, our results suggest that
      KPC-PA is becoming a clinical threat and that using CAZ-AVI to treat this
      specific pathogen should be done with caution. IMPORTANCE Previous
      research has reported several cases of KPC-PA strains and three
      KPC-encoding P. aeruginosa plasmid types in China. However, the prevalence
      and clinical significance of KPC-PA are not available. In addition, the
      susceptibility of the strains to CAZ-AVI remains unknown. Samples in this
      study were collected from seven tertiary hospitals prior to CAZ-AVI
      clinical approval in China. Therefore, our results represent a
      retrospective study establishing the baseline efficacy of the novel
      β-lactam/β-lactamase combination agent for treating KPC-PA infections. The
      observed correlation between the bla(KPC) copy number and CAZ-AVI
      resistance suggests that close monitoring of the susceptibility of the
      strain during treatment is required. It would also be beneficial to screen
      for the bla(KPC) gene in CRPA strains for antimicrobial surveillance
      purposes.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to understand the distribution characteristics
      of carbapenemase genes and assess the antimicrobial activities of
      aztreonam/avibactam (ATM/AVI) and ceftazidime/avibactam (CAZ/AVI) against
      carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) isolates in Chongqing,
      Southwest China. METHODS: CRE isolates and their clinical information were
      collected from 22 hospitals covering all the five regions across Chongqing
      between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2017. PCR was used to screen for
      common carbapenemase genes. And minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs)
      were determined by broth microdilution method. RESULTS: A total of 312
      unduplicated CRE isolates (eg, 206 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 43 Escherichia
      coli, and 42 Enterobacter cloacae) were collected during the two-year
      study period. Among these CRE isolates, 92.3% carried carbapenemase genes,
      with a majority of isolates carrying single bla (KPC-2) (47.1%) or single
      bla (NDM/IPM) (36.2%) and 8.9% of isolates carrying two or three
      carbapenemase genes. Notably, 95.6% (197/206) K. pneumoniae, 86.0% (37/43)
      E. coli and 88.1% (37/42) E. cloacae harbored carbapenemase genes. In
      addition, bla (KPC-2) was prevalent in K. pneumoniae (70.4%), while bla
      (NDM) was predominant in E. coli (83.7%) and E. cloacae (78.6%). Besides,
      only metallo-β-lactamase (MBL) genes were detected in the CRE isolates
      from children. Overall, 0.0%, 48.1%, 59.0%, 61.5% and 63.1% of the CRE
      isolates were resistant to ATM/AVI, CAZ/AVI, nitrofurantoin, amikacin and
      trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, respectively. 99.7% of the total 312
      isolates could be killed by ATM/AVI with the MIC 1 μg/mL, whereas CAZ/AVI
      showed good antibacterial activity (98.0% susceptible) against the bla
      (KPC-2)-carriers with the MIC(50/90) values of 1/4 μg/mL. CONCLUSION: The
      distribution features of carbapenemase genes in Chongqing were
      comprehensively illustrated in terms of species and sources of CRE for the
      first time in this multi-center study that covered all the geographical
      locations across Chongqing. ATM/AVI showed superior activity against all
      CRE isolates regardless of their genotype, whereas CAZ/AVI was active
      against almost all KPC-producers.

AB  - The aim of this study was to analyze the antibacterial activity of four
      essential oils (EOs), Melaleuca alternifolia, Eucalyptus globulus, Mentha
      piperita, and Thymus vulgaris, in preventing the development and spread of
      extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Escherichia coli and
      Klebsiella pneumoniae, metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa and carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. A
      total of 60 strains were obtained from the stock collection from the
      Microbiology Laboratory of Hesperia Hospital, Modena, Italy. Twenty
      ESBL-producing E. coli, 5 K. pneumoniae, 13 KPC-producing K. pneumoniae,
      and 20 MBL-producing P. aeruginosa were cultured and reconfirmed as ESBL
      and carbapenamase producers. Polymerase chain reaction was used for the
      detection of genes responsible for antibiotic resistance (ESBL and
      KPC/MBL). Antibacterial activity of the EOs was determined using the agar
      disk diffusion assay, and minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were
      also evaluated. Lastly, adhesion capability and biofilm formation on
      polystyrene and glass surfaces were studied in 24 randomly selected
      strains. M. alternifolia and T. vulgaris EOs showed the best antibacterial
      activity against all tested strains and, as revealed by agar disk
      diffusion assay, M. alternifolia was the most effective, even at low
      concentrations. This effect was also confirmed by MICs, with values
      ranging from 0.5 to 16 µg/mL and from 1 to 16 µg/mL, for M. alternifolia
      and T. vulgaris EOs, respectively. The EOs' antibacterial activity
      compared to antibiotics confirmed M. alternifolia EO as the best
      antibacterial agent. T. vulgaris EO also showed a good antibacterial
      activity with MICs lower than both reference antibiotics. Lastly, a
      significant anti-biofilm activity was observed for the two EOs (*P < 0.05
      and **P < 0.01 for M. alternifolia and T. vulgaris EOs, respectively). A
      good antibacterial and anti-biofilm activity of M. alternifolia and T.
      vulgaris EOs against all selected strains was observed, thus demonstrating
      a future possible use of these EOs to treat infections caused by
      ESBL/carbapenemase-producing strains, even in association with
      antibiotics.

AB  - Dissemination of the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-encoding
      gene among Enterobacterales is common but relatively rare in Aeromonas
      spp. In this study, we characterized two KPC-2-producing Aeromonas
      hydrophila strains (Ah2101 and Ah2111), each isolated from a patient in
      different intensive care units (ICUs) of a Chinese hospital. Whole-genome
      sequencing (WGS) revealed simultaneous carriage of the bla (KPC-2) and
      imiH genes, both of which encode high-level carbapenem resistance in these
      two A. hydrophila isolates. The two isolates were shown to be clonally
      related and each isolate harbored two distinguishable bla (KPC-2)-bearing
      plasmids, only one of which was transferrable to A. hydrophila, but not
      Escherichia coli EC600 via conjugation. The genetic element that contains
      bla (KPC-2) in these two plasmids, namely ISKpn27-Δbla (TEM-1)-bla
      (KPC-2)-ISKpn6, was structurally identical, commonly detected in
      Enterobacterales, and associated with Tn3-based transposons. In addition,
      more than sixty putative genes that encode various virulence factors were
      identified in these two A. hydrophila isolates. This is the first study
      that reports clonal dissemination of carbapenem-resistant A. hydrophila
      strains carrying structurally different bla (KPC-2)-bearing plasmids.
      Further investigation is warranted to monitor the future transmission of
      bla (KPC-2)-bearing plasmids in A. hydrophila in clinical settings.

AB  - Objectives: This work was to investigate the activity and optimal
      treatments of ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA) and aztreonam-avibactam (AZA)
      against bloodstream infections caused by carbapenem resistant Klebsiella
      pneumoniae (BSIs-CRKP). Methods: A total of 318 nonduplicate BSIs-CRKP
      isolates were collected from Blood Bacterial Resistant Investigation
      Collaborative System (BRICS) program. The minimum inhibitory concentration
      (MIC) of CZA and AZA were determined by agar dilution method.
      Carbapenemase genes and multilocus sequence typing were amplified by PCR.
      Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) was conducted to calculate cumulative
      fraction of response (CFR) of different CZA or AZA administrations.
      Results: The MIC(90) of CZA and AZA were 128/4 and 1/4 mg/L, respectively.
      There are 87.4 and 3.5% isolates carried bla (KPC-2) and bla (NDM-1). A
      total of 68 ST types were identified and 29 novel ST types. ST11 accounted
      for 66.6%. Further MCS showed CFR of CZA using two-step infusion therapy
      (rapid first-step 0.5 h infusion and slow second-step 3 h infusion, TSIT)
      (2.5 g 0.5 h, 3.75 g every 8 h with 3 h infusion and 3.75 g 0.5 h, 2.5 g
      every 8 h with 3 h infusion) was above 89%. The CFR of AZA with TSIT was
      above 96%. Conclusion: TSIT with sufficient pharmacokinetic conditions
      could be useful for enhancing the therapeutic efficacy of CZA and AZA
      against BSIs-CRKP.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The primary outcome of the study was to evaluate the effect
      on 30 day mortality of the combination ceftazidime/avibactam + fosfomycin
      in the treatment of bloodstream infections (BSIs) caused by KPC-producing
      Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC-Kp). MATERIALS AND METHODS: From October 2018
      to March 2021, a retrospective, two-centre study was performed on patients
      with KPC-Kp BSI hospitalized at Sapienza University (Rome) and
      ISMETT-IRCCS (Palermo) and treated with ceftazidime/avibactam-containing
      regimens. A matched cohort (1:1) analysis was performed. Cases were
      patients receiving ceftazidime/avibactam + fosfomycin and controls were
      patients receiving ceftazidime/avibactam alone or in combination with in
      vitro non-active drugs different from fosfomycin (ceftazidime/avibactam ±
      other). Patients were matched for age, Charlson comorbidity index, ward of
      isolation (ICU or non-ICU), source of infection and severity of BSI,
      expressed as INCREMENT carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE)
      score. RESULTS: Overall, 221 patients were included in the study.
      Following the 1:1 match, 122 subjects were retrieved: 61 cases
      (ceftazidime/avibactam + fosfomycin) and 61 controls
      (ceftazidime/avibactam ± other). No difference in overall mortality
      emerged between cases and controls, whereas controls had more non-BSI
      KPC-Kp infections and a higher number of deaths attributable to secondary
      infections. Almost half of ceftazidime/avibactam + fosfomycin patients
      were prescribed fosfomycin without MIC fosfomycin availability. No
      difference in the outcome emerged after stratification for fosfomycin
      susceptibility availability and dosage. SARS-CoV-2 infection and ICS ≥ 8
      independently predicted 30 day mortality, whereas an appropriate
      definitive therapy was protective. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that
      fosfomycin was used in the treatment of KPC-Kp BSI independently from
      having its susceptibility testing available. Although no difference was
      found in 30 day overall mortality, ceftazidime/avibactam + fosfomycin was
      associated with a lower rate of subsequent KPC-Kp infections and secondary
      infections than other ceftazidime/avibactam-based regimens.

AB  - The emergence of colistin-carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae
      (CCR-Kp) in bloodstream infection results in high mortality, and virulence
      factor contributes further to the difficulty of treatment. A total of 158
      carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP) isolates causing bloodstream
      infection were collected from three Indian tertiary care hospitals during
      the 9-month study period, of which 27 isolates exhibited resistance to
      both colistin and carbapenem antibiotics. In this study, all the strains
      were characterized for antimicrobial resistance, virulence factors and
      capsular serotypes that facilitate the development of colistin and
      carbapenem-resistant K.pneumoniae (CCR-Kp) in bloodstream infection.
      Fourteen isolates displayed extremely drug resistance (XDR), susceptible
      only to tigecycline, and the remaining 13 isolates displayed multidrug
      resistance (MDR). The gene prevalence analysis for CCR-Kp isolates showed
      the predominance of bla (KPC) (81.48%) followed by bla (NDM) (62.96%), bla
      (VIM) (37.03%) and bla (IMP) (18.51%) genes. The distribution of virulence
      genes was found to be fimH (81.48%), wabG (59.25%), mrkD (55.56%), entB
      (48.15%), irp1 (33.33%), and rmpA (18.52%). The capsular serotypes K1, K2,
      K5 and K54 have been identified in 16 isolates. The absence of
      plasmid-mediated colistin resistance (mcr) genes implies the involvement
      of other mechanisms. The ERIC and (GTG)(5) molecular typing methods
      detected 18 and 22 distinct clustering patterns among the CCR-Kp isolates,
      respectively. A strong correlation between ERIC and (GTG)5 genotyping
      method was established with antimicrobial resistance patterns and
      virulence determinants at P < 0.05, while no correlation was found with
      capsular serotyping. Similar virulence and resistance typing among the
      isolates suggest hospital-acquired infection in a health care setup. These
      outcomes will advance our awareness of CCR-Kp outbreaks associated with
      tertiary care hospitals and help forecast their occurrence in the near
      future. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The online version contains
      supplementary material available at 10.1007/s13205-021-03056-4.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Carbapenemase producing Enterobacterales (CPE) are major
      public health threats. AIM: To review microbial epidemiology of CPE, as
      well as clinical risk factors and infections, amongst CPE positive
      patients over 12 years in an Irish tertiary hospital. METHODS:
      Retrospective observational study of data extracted from a laboratory CPE
      database, electronic healthcare records and manual review of patient
      charts. Common risk factors, treatment regimens for all CPE related
      infections, and clinical outcomes were ascertained. FINDINGS: Among CPE
      strains isolated from 460 patients, Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase
      (KPC) was the carbapenemase most frequently detected, accounting for 87.4%
      (459) of all CPE enzymes. Citrobacter species 177 (33.7%) were the most
      common species harbouring this enzyme. 428 CPE positive patients (93%)
      were identified in the acute hospital setting; the most common risk factor
      for CPE acquisition was history of hospitalisation, observed in 305 (66%)
      cases. Thirty patients (6.5%) had confirmed infections post-acquisition,
      of which four were bloodstream infections. There were 19 subsequent
      episodes of non CPE-related bacteraemia in this cohort. All causal
      mortality at 30 days was 41 patients (8.9%). However, clinical review
      determined that CPE was an indirect associative factor in 8 patient
      deaths. CONCLUSIONS: In this tertiary hospital setting, microbial
      epidemiology is changing; with both OXA-48 enzymes and KPC-producing
      Citrobacter species becoming more prevalent. Whilst the burden of CPE
      related infections, especially bacteraemia, was low over the study period,
      it remains critical that basic infection prevention and control practices
      are adhered to lest the observed changes in epidemiology result in an
      increase in clinical manifestations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Male genitourinary abscess is one of the serious complications
      of urinary tract infections (UTIs). There were few researches on the
      clinical and pathogenic characteristics of male genitourinary abscess.
      PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective observational study was conducted
      between January 2004 and April 2019. Male patients with genitourinary
      abscess originated from urinary tract, including sites of scrotum, testis,
      epididymis, spermatic cord, and prostate, were enrolled. Clinical and
      microbial records were collected and analyzed, and antimicrobial
      susceptibility testings were performed according to CLSI standard.
      Whole-genome sequencing was applied to detect the β-lactamase genes and
      virulence genes, as well as to determine the multilocus-sequence typing
      (MLST) of the collected Klebsiella pneumoniae (K. pneumoniae) isolates.
      RESULTS: A total of 22 male patients were included. The main clinical
      symptoms were fever (86.4%), scrotal swelling (68.2%), local skin warmth
      (59.1%) and ulceration (45.5%). Urinary irritation was often presented in
      prostate involved abscess. Ultrasound features had a 94.7% positive rate.
      Surgical treatment, including abscess drainage, was helpful to the
      prognosis. No matter where the specimens obtained from, including blood,
      urine or pus, multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae was the dominant (11
      cases, 50.0%) microorganism in positive cultures. Nine of eleven K.
      pneumoniae isolates had been preserved and recovered. As for MLST typing,
      all the nine available isolates of K. pneumoniae belonged to the ST11 type
      and characterized with bla (KPC-2) carbapenemase gene. Virulence genes
      rmpA2, ybtS, kfuC, wzi, aerobactin genes (iucABCD and iutA) and type 3
      fimbriae genes (mrkAD) were identified in all the K. pneumoniae isolates.
      CONCLUSION: It seemed that more patients under 35 years old were
      vulnerable to genitourinary abscess. There was an increasing trend that
      multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae isolates with multiple virulence genes
      were involved in male genitourinary abscess. Prompt and proper antibiotic
      use, combined with adequate drainage of the abscess, was important to
      prognosis.

AB  - The spread of multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, which is
      associated with the distribution of beta-lactamase genes and class 1 and 2
      integrons, is a global problem. In this study, in the Moscow neurosurgery
      intensive care unit (neuro-ICU), the high prevalence of the above-stated
      genes was found to be associated with intestinal and tracheal carriage.
      Seven-point prevalence surveys, which included 60 patients in the
      neuro-ICU, were conducted weekly in the period from Oct. to Nov. 2019. A
      total of 293 clinical samples were analyzed, including 146 rectal and 147
      tracheal swabs; 344 Gram-negative bacteria isolates were collected.
      Beta-lactamase genes (n = 837) were detected in the isolates, including
      beta-lactamase bla(TEM) (n = 162), bla(SHV) (n = 145), cephalosporinase
      bla(CTX-M) (n = 228), carbapenemase bla(NDM) (n = 44), bla(KPC) (n = 25),
      bla(OXA-48) (n = 126), bla(OXA-51-like) (n = 54), bla(OXA-40-like) (n =
      43), bla(OXA-23-like) (n = 8), and bla(VIM) (n = 2), as well as class 1 (n
      = 189) and class 2 (n = 12) integrons. One extensively drug-resistant
      Klebsiella pneumoniae strain (sequence type ST39 and capsular type K23),
      simultaneously carried beta-lactamase genes, bla(SHV-40) and bla(TEM-1B),
      three carbapenemase genes, bla(NDM), bla(KPC), and bla(OXA-48), the
      cephalosporinase gene bla(CTX-M), and two class 1 integrons. Before this
      study, such heavily armed strains have not been reported, suggesting the
      ongoing evolution of antibiotic resistance.

AB  - Healthcare-associated infections (HAIs) are infections that patients
      acquire while receiving medical treatment in a healthcare facility. During
      ambulatory transport, the patient may be exposed to pathogens transmitted
      from emergency medical service (EMS) personnel or EMS surfaces.The aim of
      this study was to determine whether organisms commonly associated with
      HAIs have been detected on surfaces in the patient-care compartment of
      ambulances. Five electronic databases - PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science,
      Embase and Google Scholar were used to search for articles using inclusion
      and exclusion criteria following the PRISMA checklist. Inclusion criteria
      consisted of articles published in English, between 2009 and 2020, had
      positive samples collected from the patient-care compartment of a ground
      ambulance, and reported sample collection methods of either swab sampling
      and/or Replicate Organism Detection and Counting (RODAC) contact plates.
      Studies not meeting these criteria were excluded from this review. From a
      total of 1376 articles identified, 16 were included in the review.
      Organisms associated with HAIs were commonly detected in the patient-care
      compartment of ambulances across a variety of different surfaces,
      including blood pressure cuffs, oxygen apparatuses, and areas of patient
      stretchers. A high prevalence of pathogenic bacteria in ambulances
      suggests that standard protocols related to cleaning compliance may not be
      effective. The primary recommendation is that designated subject matter
      experts in infection prevention should be incorporated as liaisons in the
      pre-hospital setting, acting as a link between the pre-hospital (e.g.,
      ambulance transport) and hospital environments.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To compare fosfomycin susceptibility testing with the
      commercial agar dilution (AD) test, AD Fosfomycin (Liofilchem, Roseto
      degli Abruzzi, Italy) and the reference AD method, using a collection of
      multidrug-resistant (MDR) Enterobacterales and Pseudomonas aeruginosa
      clinical isolates. METHODS: The collection included 119
      carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales, 53 Enterobacterales producing
      acquired AmpC-type and/or extended-spectrum β-lactamases and 38
      carbapenemase-producing P. aeruginosa, including representatives of
      different high-risk clones. AD Fosfomycin and AD reference method (ISO
      20776-1:2019) were performed starting from the same microbial suspension.
      Results were interpreted according to EUCAST clinical breakpoints (10.0).
      Essential agreement (EA), category agreement (CA) and error rates were
      calculated as described by the International Organization for
      Standardization. RESULTS: Of 172 Enterobacterales, 143 (83.1%, including
      92.9% (52 of 56) of the NDM-producers and 84.2% (48 of 57) of the
      KPC-producers) were susceptible to fosfomycin using reference AD. A CA of
      91.9% (158 of 172; 95% CI 87.1%-95.3%) and an EA of 92.5% (136 of 147; 95%
      CI 87.4%-96.0%), respectively, were calculated for the commercial AD
      Fosfomycin test, with 9.8% (14 of 128) of major errors and no very major
      errors (0 of 29). Overall, 86.8% (33 of 38) of P. aeruginosa showed a
      fosfomycin MIC ≤128 mg/L using reference AD. An EA of 84.8% (95% CI
      66.3%-92.0%) was calculated for the commercial AD Fosfomycin test, with a
      CA of 100% (95% CI 93.6%-100%) when considering a tentative breakpoint at
      128 mg/L. CONCLUSIONS: AD Fosfomycin showed an overall good concordance
      compared with reference AD.

AB  - Carbapenem-resistant gram-negative pathogens remain an urgent public
      health threat, and safe, effective treatment options are limited. Although
      several agents are now available to combat these infections,
      meropenem-vaborbactam was the first to combine a novel, cyclic, boronic
      acid-based, β-lactamase inhibitor with a carbapenem backbone. Vaborbactam
      emanated from a discovery program specifically designed to identify
      candidate β-lactamase inhibitors with biochemical, microbiologic, and
      pharmacologic properties optimized for use in conjunction with a
      carbapenem. Meropenem was selected as the ideal carbapenem given its
      broad-spectrum in vitro activity, well established safety profile, and
      proven efficacy in the treatment of serious gram-negative infections. The
      combination has demonstrated potent in vitro activity against resistant
      gram-negative pathogens, particularly KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae
      (MIC(50) values typically ≤ 0.06 mg/l). Importantly, the pharmacokinetic
      (PK) profiles of the two agents are well matched, and the approved
      optimized dosing regimen of 4 g every 8 h (Q8h) as a 3-h infusion provides
      reliable probability of target attainment against the majority of commonly
      encountered carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). Robust in vitro
      and in vivo PK/pharmacodynamic (PD) data support the ability of this
      dosing regimen to achieve specified PK/PD targets for both bactericidal
      activity and prevention of resistance among pathogens with MICs up to 8
      mg/l. This concerted effort into optimizing the PK and PD parameters of
      both the β-lactam and β-lactamase inhibitor alone and in combination
      contributed to the clinical success of meropenem-vaborbactam demonstrated
      in phase 3 trials in patients with complicated urinary tract infections
      (cUTI), including acute pyelonephritis (AP), and serious CRE infections.
      As the use of meropenem-vaborbactam increases concomitantly with the
      prevalence of KPC-producing CRE, continued pharmacovigilance and
      antimicrobial stewardship efforts will be of upmost importance to ensure
      that these PK/PD efforts translate into improved patient outcomes.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Production of Extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) and
      Carbapenemase is the most common strategy for drug resistance in clinical
      isolates of Enterobacteriaceae. This study was conducted to determine the
      magnitude of ESBL and Carbapenemase production (CPE) among clinical
      isolates of Enterobacteriaceae causing bloodstream infections (BSI) in
      Ethiopia. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed from September
      2018 to January 2019 in Ethiopia. A total of 2397 BSI suspected patients
      were enrolled and blood culture was performed using a BacT/Alert
      instrument in combination with conventional methods for identification.
      After antimicrobial susceptibility test, phenotypic confirmation of ESBLs
      was done by combined disc-diffusion. Meanwhile carbapenemase production
      was done by modified carbapenem inactivation method. Multiplex PCR was
      conducted to detect the presence of bla (CTX-M),bla (SHV,) bla (TEM), bla
      (KPC) and bla (NDM) genes. RESULTS: A total of 104 (4.3%)
      Enterobacteriaceae were isolated from 2397 BSI suspected patients.
      Klebsiella pneumoniae (55/104, 52%) was the predominant isolate followed
      by E. coli, (19.2%, 20/104) and K.oxytoca (17.3%, 18/104). ESBL and
      carbapenemase production were observed from 70 (67.3%, 57.4 -76.2% at 95%
      CI) and 8 (7.7%, 3.4-14.6% at 95% CI) isolates respectively. The highest
      frequency of ESBL and carbapenemase production was observed in K.
      pneumoniae 78.2% (43/55) and 9.1% (5/55), respectively. All the 70
      isolates confirmed as ESBL producers harbored at least one of the ESBL
      genes and the majority of them carried multiple beta-lactamase genes
      (84.3%), where bla (CTX-M,) type was the most predominant (67.3%).
      Similarly, the entire eight isolates positive for carbapenemase carried
      bla (NDM) but none of them carried bla (KPC.) CONCLUSION: In our study,
      the rate of ESBL production among BSI-causing Enterobacteriaceae was
      alarming and most of the isolates carried multiple types of ESBL genes. A
      significant magnitude of CPE isolates causing BSI was recorded.

AB  - The advent of carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) poses a
      significant challenge to public health, as carbapenems are typically
      employed as a last resort to treat nosocomial infections caused by such
      organisms, especially in intensive care units (ICUs). This study aims to
      characterize the CRKP isolated from patients admitted to the Zagazig
      University Hospitals (ZUHs) ICU in Egypt. About 56.2%, 41.0%, and 32.4% of
      the isolates indicated the presence of bla(NDM), bla(OXA-48), and
      bla(KPC), respectively. Carbapenemase-encoding genes were found in many
      isolates, and bla(NDM) was the most predominant gene. Nevertheless, this
      situation has become a heavy burden in developing countries, including
      Egypt, and is associated with substantial morbidity, mortality, and
      increased healthcare expenses.

AB  - Introduction. Infections attributable to carbapenem-resistant
      Gram-negative bacilli are increasing globally. New antimicrobial agents
      are urgently needed to treat patients with these infections.Aim. To
      describe susceptibility to the novel carbapenem-β-lactamase inhibitor
      combination imipenem-relebactam and comparators of clinical isolates of
      non-Proteeae Enterobacteriaceae (NPE) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa from
      intraabdominal infections (IAIs) and urinary tract infections
      (UTIs).Methods. Broth microdilution MICs were determined for isolates
      collected in 22 European countries in 2015-2017 and interpreted using
      EUCAST breakpoints; imipenem-relebactam MICs were interpreted using
      imipenem breakpoints.Results. For NPE, 98.4 % of isolates from IAIs
      (n=10,465) and 98.5 % of UTI isolates (n=7,446) were susceptible to
      imipenem-relebactam, as were 42.4 % of imipenem-nonsusceptible (n=474),
      98.6 % of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-positive (n=138), and
      93.9 % of multidrug-resistant (MDR) isolates (n=4,424) from IAIs and UTIs
      combined. Molecular analysis demonstrated that two-thirds of
      imipenem-nonsusceptible isolates rendered susceptible by relebactam
      carried KPCs; 96 % (261/271) of imipenem-nonsusceptible isolates of NPE
      that remained nonsusceptible in the presence of relebactam carried
      metallo-β-lactamase (MBL)-type and/or OXA-48-like carbapenemases. Among P.
      aeruginosa, 94.4 % of IAI (n=1,245) and 93.0 % of UTI isolates (n=714)
      were susceptible to imipenem-relebactam, as were 74.4 % of
      imipenem-nonsusceptible (n=469) and 79.8 % of MDR isolates (n=595) from
      IAIs and UTIs combined. Among the 120 isolates of P. aeruginosa that
      remained nonsusceptible to imipenem upon addition of relebactam, 72 %
      carried MBLs. The distribution of NPE and P. aeruginosa carrying
      carbapenemases varied substantially across Europe, as did resistance to
      imipenem and imipenem-relebactam.Conclusions. Continued surveillance of
      antimicrobial resistance and resistance mechanisms, including the study of
      imipenem-relebactam as it approaches regulatory approval, appears
      warranted.

AB  - The treatment of urinary tract infections (UTIs) has been complicated by
      the emergence of multidrug-resistant, β-lactamase-expressing pathogens. As
      a result of the limited treatment options, patients often require
      hospitalization and intravenous therapy. In essence, a strong unmet need
      for oral antibiotics, active against extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)
      uropathogens has emerged. Oral carbapenems (tebipenem and sulopenem) and
      oral cephalosporin/β-lactamase inhibitor combinations are in various
      stages of clinical development for the treatment of uncomplicated and
      complicated UTI. Tebipenem, if approved, will be the first oral treatment
      for complicated UTI while sulopenem will be for uncomplicated UTI. The
      β-lactamase inhibitors ETX0282, VNRX7145, ARX1796, and QPX7728 are
      combined with cefpodoxime proxetil or ceftibuten that achieve favorable
      exposures in urine compared to other uropathogen-active oral
      cephalosporins. The combination ceftibuten-QPX7728 has potential
      broad-spectrum coverage against carbapenemase producers including metallo
      β-lactamase producers. Other novel combinations, namely
      cefpodoxime/ETX0282, ceftibuten/VNRX-7145, and ceftibuten/ARX1796, have
      also demonstrated excellent activity against Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapanemase (KPC) and OXA-48-like producers. All these agents, upon
      their arrival for commercial use, would strengthen the outpatient therapy.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-2 (KPC-2) is a serine-β-lactamase
      (SBL) capable of hydrolysing almost all β-lactam antibiotics. We compare
      KPC-2 inhibition by vaborbactam, a clinically-approved monocyclic
      boronate, and VNRX-5133 (taniborbactam), a bicyclic boronate in late-stage
      clinical development. Vaborbactam inhibition is slowly reversible, whereas
      taniborbactam has an off-rate indicating essentially irreversible complex
      formation and a 15-fold higher on-rate, although both potentiate β-lactam
      activity against KPC-2-expressing K. pneumoniae. High resolution X-ray
      crystal structures reveal closely related binding modes for both
      inhibitors to KPC-2, with differences apparent only in positioning of the
      endocyclic boronate ester oxygen. The results indicate the bicyclic
      boronate scaffold as both an efficient, long-lasting, KPC-2 inhibitor and
      capable of supporting further iterations that may improve potency against
      specific enzyme targets and pre-empt the emergence of inhibitor resistant
      KPC-2 variants.

AB  - BACKGROUND: A growing body of evidence suggests that ceftazidime/avibactam
      (CZA) is a potential therapeutic option for carbapenem-resistant
      Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) infections; however, resistant strains are
      increasingly emerged worldwide. Herein, we deemed to investigate the
      susceptibility profile of CRKP isolates from cancer patients to CZA and to
      identify the underlying resistance mechanisms. METHODS: Clinical samples
      were obtained from adult patients admitted to the Oncology Center of
      Mansoura University, Mansoura, Egypt. The antibiotic susceptibility
      pattern of K. pneumoniae isolates to different antibiotics was tested by
      the modified Kirby Bauer's disc diffusion method. Minimum inhibitory
      concentrations of CZA were assessed using broth microdilution method.
      Screening for carbapenemase-producing strains was achieved by the modified
      Hodge test. Multiplex polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) were conducted for
      uncovering of carbapenemase-encoding genes (bla(KPC), bla(VIM), bla(IMP),
      bla(NDM-1) , and bla(OXA-48) ), and outer membrane porin genes (ompK35 and
      ompK36). RESULTS: A total of 12 CZA-resistant isolates were identified out
      of 47 CRKP isolates (25.5%). The MIC(50) and MIC(90) of CZA against CRKP
      were 1 and 64 µg/mL, respectively. Risk factors for CZA resistance
      included chronic kidney disease, mechanical ventilation, longer length of
      hospital stay, and ICU admission. The multivariate logistic regression
      demonstrated that longer length of hospital stay (P=0.03) was the only
      independent predictor for acquisition of CZA-resistant isolates. The
      leading mechanism for CZA resistance was sustained by bla(KPC) (50%),
      meanwhile 16.7% and 8.3% of the CZA-resistant isolates harbored
      bla(OXA-48) and bla(OXA-48) /bla(NDM-1) , respectively. The MBL-encoding
      genes bla(NDM-1) and bla(IMP) were detected in 16.7% and 8.3% of the
      isolates, respectively. Absence of both ompK35 and ompK36 was observed in
      58.3% of the CZA-resistant isolates. CONCLUSION: CZA has displayed
      superior in vitro activity against CRKP isolates in comparison to other
      antibiotics; however, thorough molecular characterization of resistant
      strains is highly recommended in future studies to detect and monitor the
      emergence of further tackling strains.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae is a notorious human pathogen involved in
      healthcare-associated infections. The worldwide expansion of infections
      induced by colistin-resistant and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales
      (CPE) isolates has been increasingly reported. This study aims to analyze
      the phenotypic and molecular profiles of 10 colistin-resistant (CR)
      isolates and 2 pairs of colistin-heteroresistant (ChR) (parental and the
      corresponding resistant mutants) isolates of K. pneumoniae CPE sourced
      from two hospitals. The phenotypes of strains in the selected collection
      had been previously characterized. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing
      was performed using a Vitek 2 Compact system (BioMérieux SA, Marcy
      l'Etoile, France), the disc diffusion method, and broth microdilution
      (BMD) for colistin. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) did not uncover evidence
      of any mobile colistin resistance (mcr) genes, although the mgrB gene of
      seven isolates appeared to be disrupted by insertion sequences (ISKpn25 or
      ISKpn26). Possible deleterious missense mutations were found in phoP
      (L4F), phoQ (Q426L, L26Q, L224Q, Q317K), pmrB (R256G, P95L, T157P, V352E),
      and crrB (P151S) genes. The identified isolates belonged to the following
      clonal lineages: ST101 (n = 6), ST147 (n = 5), ST258 (n = 2), and ST307 (n
      = 1). All strains harbored IncF plasmids. OXA-48 producers carried IncL
      and IncR plasmids, while one bla(NDM-1) genome was found to harbor IncC
      plasmids. Ceftazidime-avibactam remains a therapeutic option for KPC-2 and
      OXA-48 producers. Resistance to meropenem-vaborbactam has emerged in some
      bla(kPC-2)-carrying isolates. Our study demonstrates that the results of
      WGS can provide essential evidence for the surveillance of antimicrobial
      resistance.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) has become
      an urgent global public health issue, but its distribution has obvious
      regional differences. The purpose of this study was to investigate the
      patient-based disease burden and molecular epidemiology of CRKP infections
      in a tertiary hospital in northern Jiangsu Province in China. METHODS: A
      retrospective, epidemiological survey of CRKP infections in our hospital
      from January to December 2016 was conducted to collect clinical and
      epidemiologic data. Non-duplicated clinical CRKP isolates were collected
      for the resistance-associated genes and clonal correlation analysis by
      PCR, sequencing and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). RESULTS: 252 CRKP
      infection cases were collected, and the annual CRKP infection incidence of
      the hospital during 2016 was 14.64 per 10,000 hospital discharges
      (252/172,112*10,000) and 13.78 per 100,000 patient days
      (252/1,829,190*100,000). The patient-based disease burden concentrated on
      antimicrobial exposure history (133/224, 59.37%)-the most dominant STs.
      KPC-2 (120/128, 93.8%) was the predominant carbapenemase and ST11 (98/128,
      76.5%) was the dominant STs. One isolate was detected with harboring bla
      (KPC-2) and bla (MCR-1) simultaneously. CONCLUSIONS: Patient-based disease
      burden and KPC-2-producing ST11 Klebsiella pneumonia caused in higher CRKP

      (MCR-1) should be of concern.

AB  - Gram-negative bacteria are common causes of urinary tract infections
      (UTIs). Such pathogens can acquire genes encoding multiple mechanisms of
      antimicrobial resistance, including carbapenem resistance. The aim of this
      study was to detect the carbapenemase-producing ability of some
      Gram-negative bacterial isolates from urine specimens of patients
      suffering from complicated UTIs at two vital tertiary care hospitals in
      Cairo, Egypt; to determine the prevalence of carbapenemase genes among
      plasmid-bearing isolates; and explore the possibility of horizontal gene
      transfer to other bacterial species. The collected isolates were subjected
      to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, phenotypic analysis of
      carbapenemase production, and molecular detection of plasmid-borne
      carbapenemase genes, then the extracted plasmids were transformed into
      competent E. coli DH5α. A total of 256 Gram-negative bacterial clinical
      isolates were collected, 65 (25.4%) isolates showed carbapenem resistance
      of which 36 (55.4%) were carbapenemase-producers, and of these 31 (47.7%)
      harbored plasmids. The extracted plasmids were used as templates for PCR
      amplification of bla(KPC), bla(NDM), bla(VIM), bla(OXA-48,) and bla(IMP)
      carbapenemase genes. The bla(OXA-48) gene was detected in 24 (77.4%) of
      the tested isolates while bla(VIM) gene was detected in 8 (25.8%), both
      bla(KPC) and bla(NDM) genes were co-present in 1 (3.2%) isolate. Plasmids
      carrying the bla(OXA-48) gene from 4 K. pneumoniae clinical isolates were
      successfully transformed into competent E. coli DH5α. The transformants
      were carbapenemase-producers and acquired resistance to some of the tested
      antimicrobial agents as compared to untransformed E. coli DH5α. The study
      concluded that the rate of carbapenem resistance among Gram-negative
      bacterial uropathogens in Cairo, Egypt is relatively high and can be
      transferred horizontally to other bacterial host(s).

      a Chromosomal bla (KPC-2) Gene

AB  - Objectives: Bacteria carrying the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase
      genes have rapidly spread worldwide and have become a great threat to
      public health. The bla (KPC-2) gene has been primarily located on plasmids
      cocirculating in various strains. However, chromosomal integration of the
      bla (KPC) (-2) gene in Escherichia coli has not been reported. In the
      present study, we report the detection of the first clinical strain of E.
      coli ST131 with a bla (KPC) (-2) gene, which integrated in the chromosome.
      E. coli strain EC3385 was identified and subjected to susceptibility
      testing and genotyping. The complete genome sequences of this strain and
      four Proteus mirabilis strains were obtained. Chromosomal integration of
      the bla (KPC-2) gene was confirmed using a combination of short- and
      long-read sequencing. Comparative genetic analyses were performed and the
      origin of the chromosomal location of the bla (KPC-2) gene was further
      analyzed. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that strain EC3385 belonged to
      the ST131 type and possessed various resistance and virulence genes.
      Sequence analysis showed that the bla (KPC-2) gene was carried in a 24-kb
      insertion sequence on the chromosome. This insertion sequence possessed
      high sequence similarity to previously reported bla (KPC-2) -habouring
      plasmids of P. mirabilis in China. To the best of our knowledge, this is
      the first report of a clinical ST131 E. coli strain carrying bla (KPC-2)
      on the chromosome. The bla (KPC-2) gene was probably horizontally
      transferred from the P. mirabilis plasmid to the E. coli chromosome by the
      IS26 element, indicating that P. mirabilis might be an important reservoir
      of bla (KPC-2) gene for E. coli. Furthermore, the E. coli ST131 strain
      carrying the chromosomal bla (KPC) (-2) gene could be further spread due
      to its carbapenem resistance and high virulence. It is imperative to
      perform active surveillance to prevent further dissemination of KPC-2 type
      carbapenemase-producing isolates.

AB  - Infections due to Klebsiella pneumoniae have been increasing in intensive
      care units (ICUs) in the last decade. Such infections pose a serious
      problem, especially when antimicrobial resistance is present. We created a
      task force of experts, including specialists in intensive care medicine,
      anaesthesia, microbiology and infectious diseases, selected on the basis
      of their varied experience in the field of nosocomial infections, who
      conducted a comprehensive review of the recently published literature on
      the management of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE)
      infections in the intensive care setting from 2012 to 2022 to summarize
      the best available treatment. The group established priorities regarding
      management, based on both the risk of developing infections caused by K.
      pneumoniae and the risk of poor outcome. Moreover, we reviewed and updated
      the most important clinical entities and the new antibiotic treatments
      recently developed. After analysis of the priorities outlined, this group
      of experts established a series of recommendations and designed a
      management algorithm.

AB  - Antibiotic-resistant Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter baumannii are
      problematic pathogens, with few treatment options for multidrug-resistant
      (MDR)-A. baumannii and few oral options for extended spectrum β-lactamase
      (ESBL)-producing and MDR-Enterobacteriaceae. Omadacycline, a newer
      tetracycline derivative, has activity against some of these pathogens. We
      tested the in vitro activity of omadacycline against a contemporary
      collection of over 2,600 consecutive unique clinical isolates of
      Enterobacteriaceae and A. baumannii, a previous collection of
      carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and A. baumannii from a
      surveillance study in 2013-2014, and a group of K. pneumoniae and A.
      baumannii isolates with previously defined resistance mechanisms. For the
      contemporary collection, over 96% of Escherichia coli and 70% of K.
      pneumoniae isolates were inhibited by omadacycline at ≤4 μg/mL including
      95% of E. coli and 49% of K. pneumoniae with presumptive ESBLs. Nearly 90%
      of A. baumannii were inhibited by omadacycline at ≤4 μg/mL. The
      omadacycline MIC(50/90) was 1/4 μg/mL, 4/>8 μg/mL, and 0.5/8 for E. coli,
      K. pneumoniae, and A. baumannii, respectively. For the
      carbapenem-resistant collection of isolates, 56% of A. baumannii were
      inhibited by omadacycline at ≤4 μg/mL, but only 30% of Klebsiella
      pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-possessing K. pneumoniae were susceptible.
      Expression of the efflux gene adeB appeared to affect the activity of
      omadacycline against A. baumannii, but could not fully explain resistance
      to this agent. Omadacycline may prove to be a parenteral or oral option
      for some infections due to ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae and
      carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii, and clinical studies are warranted.

AB  - This study aimed to detect carbapenemase genes and to determine the in
      vitro susceptibility of Ceftazidime-Avibactam (CZA) in Enterobacterales
      isolates. Carbapenemase genes were detected by polymerase chain reaction.
      CZA sensitivity of isolates was evaluated with broth microdilution (BMD)
      and disk diffusion methods. A total of 318 carbapenem-resistant
      Enterobacterales isolates were included. Most of the isolates (n = 290,
      91.2%) were identified as Klebsiella pneumoniae. The most common
      carbapenemase type was OXA-48 (n = 82, 27.6%). CZA susceptibility was
      evaluated in 84 isolates with OXA-48 and KPC carbapenemase activity. Both
      BMD and disk diffusion methods revealed that 95.2% of the isolates were
      sensitive to CZA; whereas, 4 (4.76%) isolates were resistant to CZA. Among
      colistin resistant isolates, 96.5% (n = 80) of them were susceptible to
      CZA. Our study demonstrated high in vitro efficacy of CZA in
      Enterobacterales isolates producing OXA-48 carbapenemase. High
      susceptibility rates against colistin resistant isolates which generally
      are also pan drug resistant, makes CZA a promising therapeutic choice for
      difficult-to-treat infections. Due to its high correlation with the BMD,
      disk diffusion method is a suitable and more practical method in detecting
      CZA in vitro activity.

AB  - The spread of carbapenem- and polymyxin-resistant Enterobacteriaceae poses
      a significant threat to public health, challenging clinicians worldwide
      with limited therapeutic options. This review describes the current coding
      and noncoding genetic and transcriptional mechanisms mediating carbapenem
      and polymyxin resistance, respectively. A systematic review of all studies
      published in PubMed database between 2015 to October 2020 was performed.
      Journal articles evaluating carbapenem and polymyxin resistance
      mechanisms, respectively, were included. The search identified 171 journal
      articles for inclusion. Different New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM)
      carbapenemase variants had different transcriptional and affinity
      responses to different carbapenems. Mutations within the Klebsiella
      pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) mobile transposon, Tn4401, affect its
      promoter activity and expression levels, increasing carbapenem resistance.
      Insertion of IS26 in ardK increased imipenemase expression 53-fold. ompCF
      porin downregulation (mediated by envZ and ompR mutations), micCF small
      RNA hyperexpression, efflux upregulation (mediated by acrA, acrR, araC,
      marA, soxS, ramA, etc.), and mutations in acrAB-tolC mediated clinical
      carbapenem resistance when coupled with β-lactamase activity in a
      species-specific manner but not when acting without β-lactamases.
      Mutations in pmrAB, phoPQ, crrAB, and mgrB affect phosphorylation of lipid
      A of the lipopolysaccharide through the pmrHFIJKLM (arnBCDATEF or pbgP)
      cluster, leading to polymyxin resistance; mgrB inactivation also affected
      capsule structure. Mobile and induced mcr, efflux hyperexpression and
      porin downregulation, and Ecr transmembrane protein also conferred
      polymyxin resistance and heteroresistance. Carbapenem and polymyxin
      resistance is thus mediated by a diverse range of genetic and
      transcriptional mechanisms that are easily activated in an inducing
      environment. The molecular understanding of these emerging mechanisms can
      aid in developing new therapeutics for multidrug-resistant
      Enterobacteriaceae isolates.

AB  - Infections caused by carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) are
      an emerging threat in both solid organ and stem cell transplant
      recipients. Invasive CPE infections in transplant recipients are
      associated with a high mortality, often due to limited therapeutic options
      and antibacterial toxicities. One of the most therapeutically challenging
      group of CPE are the metallo-β-lactamase (MBL)-producing Gram-negative
      bacteria, which are now found worldwide, and often need treatment with
      older, highly toxic antimicrobial regimens. Newer β-lactamase inhibitors
      such as avibactam have well-established activity against certain
      carbapenemases such as Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPC), but
      have no activity against MBL-producing organisms. Conversely, aztreonam
      has activity against MBL-producing organisms but is often inactivated by
      other co-existing β-lactamases. Here, we report four cases of invasive
      MBL-CPE infections in transplant recipients caused by IMP-4-producing
      Enterobacter cloacae who were successfully treated with a new,
      mechanism-driven antimicrobial combination of ceftazidime/avibactam with
      aztreonam. This novel antimicrobial combination offers a useful treatment
      option for high-risk patients with CPE infection, with reduced drug
      interactions and toxicity.

AB  - BACKGROUND & OBJECTIVE: Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae is a
      growing concern worldwide including Iran. The emergence of this pathogen
      is worrying as carbapenem is one of the 'last-line' antibiotics for
      treatment of infections caused by multi drug resistant gram- negative
      bacteria. The main objective of this study was to determine the prevalence
      of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in a referral hospital in
      Tehran, Iran. METHODS: In this study, all positive isolates of
      Enterobacteriaceae recorded in blood, urine, and other body fluids were
      studied during April 2017 to April 2018 in a referral hospital in Tehran.
      All cases of resistance to carbapenems were first tested by modified Hodge
      test. All cases with positive or negative test, after gene extraction,
      were examined genotypically based on the primers designed for the three
      Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase
      (NDM), and OXA-48 genes by conventional PCR method. RESULTS: 108 isolates
      (13.6%) were resistant to all cephalosporins as well as to imipenem and
      meropenem. In a genotypic study, including 45 isolates, 13 isolates were
      positive for OXA-48 gene, 11 isolates for OXA-48 and NDM genes, 11
      isolates for OXA-48, NDM and KPC genes, 4 isolates for OXA-48 genes and
      KPC, 3 isolates for NDM, one isolate for KPC. On the other hand, two
      isolates were negative for all three genes examined. CONCLUSION: OXA-48
      gene was one of the most common genes resistant to carbapenems in Iran.
      According to studies, the prevalence of antibiotic resistance in Iran is
      rising dramatically, which reduces the choice of antibiotics to treat
      severe infections in the future.

AB  - Antimicrobial resistance is increasing in prevalence and there is a clear
      need for the development of rapid detection methods in clinical
      diagnostics. This review explores -omics studies utilising mass
      spectrometry to investigate the molecular phenotype associated with
      carbapenem resistance. Whilst the specific mechanisms of carbapenem
      resistance are well characterised, the resistant phenotype is poorly
      understood. Understanding how the acquisition of resistance affects
      cellular physiology and cell metabolism through molecular phenotyping is a
      necessary step towards detecting resistance by diagnostic means. In
      addition, this article examines the potential of mass spectrometry for the
      identification of resistance biomarkers through molecular profiling of
      bacteria. Developments in mass spectrometry platforms are expanding the
      biomarker-based diagnostic landscape. Targeted measures, such as
      high-resolution mass spectrometry coupled with chromatographic separation
      show considerable promise for the identification of molecular signatures
      and the development of a rapid diagnostic assay for the detection of
      carbapenem resistance.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) producers are an emerging threat
      to global health, and the hospital water environment is considered an
      important reservoir of these life-threatening bacteria. We characterized
      plasmids of KPC-2-producing Citrobacter freundii and Klebsiella variicola
      isolates recovered from hospital sewage in Japan. Antimicrobial
      susceptibility testing, whole-genome sequencing analysis, bacterial
      conjugation, and transformation experiments were performed for both KPC-2
      producers. The bla(KPC-2) gene was located on the Tn3 transposon-related
      region from an IncP-6 replicon plasmid that could not be transferred via
      conjugation. Compared to the bla(KPC-2)-encoding plasmid of the C.
      freundii isolate, alignment analysis of plasmids with bla(KPC-2) showed
      that the bla(KPC-2)-encoding plasmid of the K. variicola isolate was a
      novel IncP-6/IncF-like hybrid plasmid containing a 75,218-bp insertion
      sequence composed of IncF-like plasmid conjugative transfer proteins.
      Carbapenem-resistant transformants harboring bla(KPC-2) were obtained for
      both isolates. However, no IncF-like insertion region was found in the K.
      variicola donor plasmid of the transformant, suggesting that this
      IncF-like region is not readily functional for plasmid conjugative
      transfer and is maintained depending on the host cells. The findings on
      the KPC-2 producers and novel genetic content emphasize the key role of
      hospital sewage as a potential reservoir of pathogens and its linked
      dissemination of bla(KPC-2) through the hospital water environment. Our
      results indicate that continuous monitoring for environmental emergence of
      antimicrobial-resistant bacteria might be needed to control the spread of
      these infectious bacteria. Moreover, it will help elucidate both the
      evolution and transmission pathways of these bacteria harboring
      antimicrobial resistance. IMPORTANCE Antimicrobial resistance is a
      significant problem for global health, and the hospital environment has
      been recognized as a reservoir of antimicrobial resistance. Here, we
      provide insight into the genomic features of bla(KPC-2)-harboring isolates
      of Citrobacter freundii and Klebsiella variicola obtained from hospital
      sewage in Japan. The findings of carbapenem-resistant bacteria containing
      this novel genetic context emphasize that hospital sewage could act as a
      potential reservoir of pathogens and cause the subsequent spread of
      bla(KPC-2) via horizontal gene transfer in the hospital water environment.
      This indicates that serial monitoring for environmental bacteria
      possessing antimicrobial resistance may help us control the spread of
      infection and also lead to elucidating the evolution and transmission
      pathways of these bacteria.

AB  - AIM: This report presents phenotypic and genetic data on the prevalence
      and characteristics of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) and
      representative carbapenemases-producing Gram-negative species in Mexico.
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 52 centers participated, 43
      hospital-based laboratories and 9 external laboratories. The distribution
      of antimicrobial resistance data for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella
      pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae complex, Acinetobacter baumannii complex,
      and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in selected clinical specimens from January 1
      to March 31, 2020 was analyzed using the WHONET 5.6 platform. The
      following clinical isolates recovered from selected specimens were
      included: carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, ESBL or
      carbapenem-resistant E. coli, and K. pneumoniae, carbapenem-resistant A.
      baumannii complex, and P. aeruginosa. Strains were genotyped to detect
      ESBL and/or carbapenemase-encoding genes. RESULTS: Among blood isolates,
      A. baumannii complex showed more than 68% resistance for all antibiotics
      tested, and among Enterobacteria, E. cloacae complex showed higher
      resistance to carbapenems. A. baumannii complex showed a higher resistance
      pattern for respiratory specimens, with only amikacin having a resistance
      lower than 70%. Among K. pneumoniae isolates, blaTEM, blaSHV, and blaCTX
      were detected in 68.79%, 72.3%, and 91.9% of isolates, respectively. Among
      E. coli isolates, blaTEM, blaSHV, and blaCTX were detected in 20.8%,
      4.53%, and 85.7% isolates, respectively. For both species, the most
      frequent genotype was blaCTX-M-15. Among Enterobacteriaceae, the most
      frequently detected carbapenemase-encoding gene was blaNDM-1 (81.5%),
      followed by blaOXA-232 (14.8%) and blaoxa-181(7.4%), in A. baumannii was
      blaOXA-24 (76%) and in P. aeruginosa, was blaIMP (25.3%), followed by
      blaGES and blaVIM (13.1% each). CONCLUSION: Our study reports that NDM-1
      is the most frequent carbapenemase-encoding gene in Mexico in
      Enterobacteriaceae with the circulation of the oxacillinase genes 181 and
      232. KPC, in contrast to other countries in Latin America and the USA, is
      a rare occurrence. Additionally, a high circulation of ESBL blaCTX-M-15
      exists in both E. coli and K. pneumoniae.

AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate polymyxin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae and
      Escherichia coli prevalence and characteristics in the Henan province,
      China. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 2301 bacterial isolates collected
      at six hospitals were assessed. Their response to polymyxin was evaluated
      by minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) analysis, and the mobilized
      colistin resistance (mcr) and carbapenemase gene were explored. Mutations
      on mgrB, phoPQ, pmrAB, and crrAB in polymyxin-resistant K. pneumoniae were
      detected by PCR. phoP, phoQ, pmrK, pmrA, pmrB, and pmrC transcriptional
      levels were quantified by RT-qPCR. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
      and multi-locus sequence typing were performed to determine the
      phylogenetic relationship between the polymyxin-resistant isolates.
      RESULTS: Of the E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates identified, 0.3% and
      1.4% were polymyxin-resistant, respectively, with MICs of 4-64 μg/mL. All
      polymyxin-resistant isolates were susceptible to tigecycline. Four E. coli
      isolates were mcr-1-positive and one was carbapenem-resistant, carrying
      bla (NDM-5) and mcr-1. One K. pneumoniae isolate was mcr-1-positive and
      nine were carbapenem-resistant (PRCRKP), carrying bla (KPC-2) but not
      mcr-1. The five E. coli isolates belonged to four sequence types (ST2,
      ST132, ST632, and ST983). All PRCRKP isolates belonged to ST11. However,
      all 16 isolates belonged to different PFGE types with <95% genetic
      similarity. Insertion sequences in mgrB were detected in nine (81.8%)
      polymyxin-resistant K. pneumoniae samples. Colistin resistance was linked
      with pmrHFIJKLM operon upregulation, with phoP, phoQ, and pmrK being
      overexpressed in all but one of the polymyxin-resistant K. pneumoniae
      samples. Furthermore, 33.3% of patients carrying polymyxin-resistant
      isolates had previously used polymyxin, and 66.7% patients displayed good
      clinical outcomes. CONCLUSION: The K. pneumoniae polymyxin resistance rate
      was slightly higher than that of E. coli and mcr-1 was more common in E.
      coli than in K. pneumoniae. Moreover, the insertion of ISkpn14 into mgrB
      may be the main contributor to polymyxin-resistance in K. pneumoniae in
      Henan.

AB  - The objective of this study was to investigate the presence and
      persistence of carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella spp. isolated from
      wastewater and treated wastewater from two tertiary hospitals in Mexico.
      We conducted a descriptive cross-sectional study in two hospital
      wastewater treatment plants, which were sampled in February 2020. We
      obtained 30 Klebsiella spp. isolates. Bacterial identification was carried
      out by the Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization-Time of Flight mass
      spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS(®)) and antimicrobial susceptibility profiles
      were performed using the VITEK2(®) automated system. The presence of
      carbapenem resistance genes (CRGs) in Klebsiella spp. isolates was
      confirmed by PCR. Molecular typing was determined by pulsed-field gel
      electrophoresis (PFGE). High rates of Klebsiella spp. resistance to
      cephalosporins and carbapenems (80%) were observed in isolates from
      treated wastewater from both hospitals. The molecular screening by PCR
      showed the presence of bla(KPC) and bla(OXA-48-like) genes. The PFGE
      pattern separated the Klebsiella isolates into 19 patterns (A-R) with
      three subtypes (C1, D1, and I1). Microbiological surveillance and
      identification of resistance genes of clinically important pathogens in
      hospital wastewater can be a general screening method for early
      determination of under-detected antimicrobial resistance profiles in
      hospitals and early warning of outbreaks and difficult-to-treat
      infections.

AB  - The rapidly increasing prevalence of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase 2
      (KPC-2)-producing bacteria has become a serious challenge to public
      health. Currently, the bla (KPC-) (2) gene is mainly disseminated through
      plasmids of different sizes and replicon types. However, the plasmids
      carrying the bla (KPC-) (2) gene have not been fully characterized. In
      this study, we report the complete genome sequences of two novel bla
      (KPC-) (2)-harboring incompatibility group U (IncU) plasmids, pEC2341-KPC
      and pEC2547-KPC, from international high-risk clones of Escherichia coli
      isolated from Zhejiang, China. Two KPC-2-producing E. coli isolates
      (EC2341 and EC2547) were collected from clinical samples. Whole-genome
      sequencing (WGS) analysis indicated that EC2341 and EC2547 belonged to the
      ST410 and ST131 clones, respectively. S1-nuclease pulsed-field gel
      electrophoresis (S1-PFGE), Southern blot and conjugation experiments
      confirmed the presence of the bla (KPC-) (2) gene on the pEC2341-KPC
      plasmid and that this was a conjugative plasmid, while the bla (KPC-) (2)
      gene on the pEC2547-KPC plasmid was a non-conjugative plasmid. In
      addition, plasmid analysis further revealed that the two bla (KPC-)
      (2)-harboring plasmids have a close evolutionary relationship. To the best
      of our knowledge, this is the first report of E. coli strains carrying the
      bla (KPC-) (2) gene on IncU plasmids. The emergence of the IncU-type bla
      (KPC-) (2)-positive plasmid highlights further dissemination of bla (KPC-)
      (2) in Enterobacteriaceae. Therefore, effective measures should be taken
      immediately to prevent the spread of these bla (KPC-) (2) (-)positive
      plasmids.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Searching the risk factors for carbapenem-resistant
      Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) infection is important in clinical practice. In
      the present study, we aim to investigate bacterial characteristics of
      colonizing strains and their correlation with subsequent CRE infection.
      METHODS: Between May 2018 and January 2019, patients hospitalized in the
      department of haematology and intensive care unit (ICU) were screened for
      CRE by rectal swabs and monitored for the outcome of infection. We
      identified the species and carbapenemase-encoding genes of colonizing
      strains and performed antimicrobial susceptibility tests and multilocus
      sequence typing (MLST). Risk factors for subsequent CRE infections were
      ascertained by univariate and multivariable analysis. RESULTS: We
      collected a total of 219 colonizing strains from 153 patients. Klebsiella
      pneumoniae was the most abundant species, and MLST analysis showed rich
      diversity. K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) was predominant in the
      infection group (72.4%). In the non-infection group, 35.4% of strains were
      non-carbapenemase-producing CRE (NCP-CRE), and New Delhi
      metallo-β-lactamase (NDM) was predominant (42.2%). The rate of high-level
      carbapenem resistance (minimum inhibitory concentration [MIC] ≥ 64 mg/L
      for meropenem and ertapenem, ≥ 32 mg/L for imipenem) was remarkably higher
      in the infection group than in the non-infection group (P < 0.001).
      Univariate analysis showed that K. pneumoniae, high-level carbapenem
      resistance, CP-CRE and KPC-CRE were infection risk factors after CRE
      colonization. On multivariable analysis with different carbapenemase
      dichotomizations, KPC-CRE (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 4.507; 95%
      confidence interval [CI], 1.339-15.171; P = 0.015) or imipenem MIC ≥ 32
      mg/L (aOR, 9.515; 95% CI, 1.617-55.977; P = 0.013) were respectively
      identified as independent risk factors for subsequent infection.
      CONCLUSIONS: Patients colonized with KPC-CRE or strains with an imipenem
      MIC ≥ 32 mg/L were at particularly high risk of subsequent CRE infections
      during their hospital stay.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore the real-life performance of meropenem/vaborbactam
      for treating serious KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae infections,
      including those resistant to ceftazidime/avibactam. METHODS: A
      retrospective observational cohort study was conducted in 12 Italian
      hospitals. Enrolled patients had K. pneumoniae carbapenemase
      (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) infections (59.5% of which were
      ceftazidime/avibactam resistant). Patients who received ≥72 h of
      meropenem/vaborbactam therapy (with or without other antimicrobials) in a
      compassionate-use setting were included. RESULTS: The 37 infections (all
      hospital-acquired) were mainly bacteraemic (BSIs, n = 23) or lower
      respiratory tract infections (LRTIs, n = 10). Clinical cure was achieved
      in 28 (75.6%) cases and microbiologically confirmed in all 25 with
      follow-up cultures. Three (10.7%) of the 28 clinical cures (all BSIs, 2/3
      microbiologically confirmed) were followed by in-hospital recurrences
      after meropenem/vaborbactam was discontinued (median interval: 18 days).
      All three recurrences were susceptible to meropenem/vaborbactam and
      successfully managed with meropenem/vaborbactam combined with colistin or
      fosfomycin. Nine patients (24.3%) (all with BSIs or LRTIs) died in
      hospital with persistent signs of infection. Most were aged over 60 years,
      with high comorbidity burdens and INCREMENT scores ≥8. Only one had
      received meropenem/vaborbactam monotherapy. Six began
      meropenem/vaborbactam therapy >48 h after infection onset. Outcomes were
      unrelated to the isolate's ceftazidime/avibactam susceptibility status.
      The single adverse event observed consisted of severe leukopenia with
      thrombocytopenia. CONCLUSIONS: With the well-known limitations of
      real-life retrospective studies, our results support previous findings
      indicating that meropenem/vaborbactam therapy will be a safe, effective
      tool for managing serious KPC-Kp infections, including the increasing
      proportion displaying resistance to ceftazidime/avibactam.

AB  - The emergence of virulent extended spectrum β-lactamase producing
      Klebsiella pneumoniae (ESBL-KP) including carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella
      pneumoniae (CRKP) in hospital-acquired infections has resulted in
      significant morbidity and mortality worldwide. We investigated the
      antibiotic resistance and virulence factors associated with ESBL-KP and
      CRKP in tertiary care hospitals in Bangladesh and explored their ability
      to form biofilm. A total of 67 ESBL-KP were isolated from 285 Klebsiella
      pneumoniae isolates from environmental and patient samples from January
      2019 to April 2019. For ESBL-KP isolates, molecular typing was carried out
      using enterobacterial repetitive intergenic consensus polymerase chain
      reaction (ERIC-PCR), antibiotic susceptibility testing, PCR for virulence
      and drug-resistant genes, and biofilm assays were also performed. All 67
      isolates were multidrug-resistant (MDR) to different antibiotics at high
      levels and 42 isolates were also carbapenem-resistant. The most common
      β-lactam resistance gene was bla(CTX-M-1) (91%), followed by bla(TEM)
      (76.1%), bla(SHV) (68.7%), bla(OXA-1) (29.9%), bla(GES) (14.9%),
      bla(CTX-M-9) (11.9%), and bla(CTX-M-2) (4.5%). The carbapenemase genes
      bla(KPC) (55.2%), bla(IMP) (28.4%), bla(VIM) (14.9%), bla(NDM-1) (13.4%),
      and bla(OXA-48) (10.4%) and virulence-associated genes such as fimH
      (71.6%), ugeF (58.2%), wabG (56.7%), ureA (47.8%) and kfuBC (28.4%) were
      also detected. About 96.2% of the environmental and 100% of the patient
      isolates were able to form biofilms. ERIC-PCR-based genotyping and
      hierarchical clustering of K. pneumoniae isolates revealed an association
      between environmental and patient samples, indicating clonal association
      with possible transmission of antimicrobial resistance genes. Our findings
      can help in improving patient care and infection control, and the
      development of public health policies related to hospital-acquired
      infections.

AB  - Research in identifying alternative growth media that better mimic host
      conditions is gaining ground. Relative to nutrient-rich Mueller-Hinton
      broth (MHB), data on the influence of physiologic or host-mimicking media
      on metallo-β-lactamase (MBL) resistance are lacking. The objective was to
      evaluate meropenem susceptibility against clinical and engineered
      MBL-harboring Enterobacterales strains in a physiologic medium (urine).
      Antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) by broth microdilution was
      conducted with a wild-type Klebsiella pneumoniae strain and two engineered
      isogenic variants harboring K. pneumoniae carbapenemase 2 (KPC-2) or New
      Delhi MBL 1 (NDM-1), as well as two clinical K. pneumoniae isolates
      (harboring NDM-1 and VIM-1). MICs were determined in conventional
      cation-adjusted MHB (caMHB) and sterile-filtered urine samples (18
      patients). All KPC- and MBL-harboring isolates were meropenem resistant
      (MICs of ≥16 mg/liter) in caMHB. AST of the KPC isolate in urine resulted
      in 50% (9/18 urine samples) essential agreement (i.e., within ±1 dilution,
      relative to the caMHB MIC), highlighting challenges with the use of urine
      as a medium capable of supporting AST. In the 9 AST-viable urine samples,
      meropenem MICs were 2- to 9-fold lower than that in caMHB (MIC of 32
      mg/liter) among MBL-harboring isolates. Zinc concentrations determined by
      inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry averaged 1.25 mg/liter and
      ranged from 0.12 to 1.14 mg/liter in caMHB and 18 urine samples,
      respectively. The full extent of MBL-mediated resistance among K.
      pneumoniae isolates appears to be attenuated in urine. Factors influencing
      free bioactive zinc levels warrant further investigation. IMPORTANCE
      Studies assessing antibiotic susceptibility profiles in nonconventional
      media are lacking. MBL-mediated resistance has come under scrutiny due to
      the dependence on extracellular zinc concentrations, which makes the
      choice of testing medium influential for β-lactam MICs. This study
      explores human urine as a physiologically relevant matrix with which
      susceptibility profiles of MBL-harboring isolates can be assessed,
      relative to conventional broth.

AB  - Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) are pathogens that have been
      found in several countries, with a significant public health concern.
      Characterizing the mode of resistance and determining the prevailing
      clones are vital to the epidemiology of CRE in our community. This study
      was conducted to characterize the molecular mode of resistance and to
      determine the clonality of the CRE fecal isolates among community food
      handlers (FHs) vs. infected control patients (ICPs) in Kuwait. Fecal CRE
      isolates obtained from FHs and ICPs from September 2016 to September 2018
      were analyzed for their resistance genes. Gene characterization was
      carried out by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays and sequencing.
      Clonality of isolates was established by multilocus sequence typing
      (MLST). Of the 681 and 95 isolates of the family Enterobacterales isolated
      from FHs and ICPs, 425 (62.4%) and 16 (16.8%) were Escherichia coli, and
      18 (2.6%) and 69 (72.6%) were Klebsiella pneumoniae, respectively. A total
      of 36 isolates were CRE with a prevalence of 5.3% among FH isolates and 87
      (91.6%) among the ICPs. Of these, carbapenemase genes were detected in 22
      (61.1%) and 65 (74.7%) isolates, respectively (p < 0.05). The detected
      specific genes among FHs and ICPs were positive for bla (KPC) 19 (86.4%)
      and 35 (40.2%), and bla (OXA) 10 (45.5%) and 59 (67.8%), in addition to
      bla (NDM) 2 (9.1%) and 32 (36.8%), respectively. MLST assays of the E.
      coli and K. pneumoniae isolates revealed considerable genetic diversity
      and polyclonality as well as demonstrated multiple known ST types and
      eight novel sequence types. The study revealed a relatively high number of
      CRE harboring predominantly bla (KPC)-mediated CRE among the community FH
      isolates vs. predominant bla (OXA) genes among the ICPs. Those
      heterogeneous CRE isolates raise concerns and mandate more efforts toward
      molecular surveillance. A multinational study is recommended to monitor
      the spread of genes mediating CRE in the community of Arabian Peninsula
      countries.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Concerns are growing over the importance of the hospital water
      environment for the transmission of carbapenemase-producing
      Enterobacteriaceae (CPE). AIM: To report a large outbreak in the
      cardiology units involving intensive care units (ICUs) and wards at a
      tertiary-care hospital. METHODS: This was a contact tracing, case-control
      study to find the risk factors for acquisition of CPE and environmental
      sampling was performed during a CPE outbreak between July and December
      2018. FINDINGS: A total of 87 patients with CPE infection or colonization
      were identified in the cardiology units of the Asan Medical Centre.
      Diverse organisms were identified containing bla(kpc), bla(NDM-1),
      bla(VIM) or bla(IMP), bla(OXA-48,) and co-producing organisms. A
      case-control study indicated that using the sinks in the ward patient room
      bathroom for teeth brushing was associated with CPE acquisition (83% vs
      30%; P=0.03). The environment was cultured and Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Escherichia coli was isolated from a water
      dispenser and New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM) 1-producing
      Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae from sinks in patient rooms.
      Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis of KPC-producing E. coli
      from patients and the water dispenser in ICU and NDM-1-producing E.
      cloacae from the patient and sink drain showed the same pulsotypes.
      CONCLUSIONS: The water dispenser and sink drain were suspected as possible
      reservoirs of CPE in this outbreak. Close contacts with contaminated water
      such as tooth brushing were identified as risk factors for CPE
      acquisition. Education for the adequate use of the water environment
      system as well as the control of the hospital water environment should be
      implemented to prevent the CPE outbreaks.

AB  - QPX7728 is an ultrabroad-spectrum boronic acid beta-lactamase inhibitor,
      with potent inhibition of key serine and metallo-beta-lactamases being
      observed in biochemical assays. Microbiological studies using
      characterized strains were used to provide a comprehensive
      characterization of the spectrum of beta-lactamase inhibition by QPX7728.
      The MICs of multiple antibiotics administered intravenously only
      (ceftazidime, piperacillin, cefepime, ceftolozane, and meropenem) and
      orally bioavailable antibiotics (ceftibuten, cefpodoxime, tebipenem) alone
      and in combination with QPX7728 (4 μg/ml), as well as comparator agents,
      were determined against panels of laboratory strains of Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa and Klebsiella pneumoniae expressing over 55 diverse serine and
      metallo-beta-lactamases. QPX7728 significantly enhanced the potency of
      antibiotics against strains expressing class A extended-spectrum
      beta-lactamases (CTX-M, SHV, TEM, VEB, PER) and carbapenemases (KPC, SME,
      NMC-A, BKC-1), consistent with the beta-lactamase inhibition demonstrated
      in biochemical assays. It also inhibited both plasmidic (CMY, FOX, MIR,
      DHA) and chromosomally encoded (P99, PDC, ADC) class C beta-lactamases and
      class D enzymes, including carbapenemases, such as OXA-48 from
      Enterobacteriaceae and OXA enzymes from Acinetobacter baumannii
      (OXA-23/24/72/58). QPX7728 is also a potent inhibitor of many class B
      metallo-beta-lactamases (NDM, VIM, CcrA, IMP, and GIM but not SPM or L1).
      Addition of QPX7728 (4 μg/ml) reduced the MICs for a majority of the
      strains to the level observed for the control with the vector alone,
      indicative of complete beta-lactamase inhibition. The ultrabroad-spectrum
      beta-lactamase inhibition profile makes QPX7728 a viable candidate for
      further development.

AB  - The presence of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producing bacteria in
      environmental sources has been reported worldwide and constitutes a
      serious risk of community-acquired infections with limited treatment
      options. The current study aimed to explore the presence of these
      worrisome bacteria in a pond located at the Norwegian University of Life
      Sciences in Ås, Norway. A total of 98 bacterial isolates survived growth
      on selective chromogenic media and were identified by 16S rRNA Sanger
      sequencing. All strains were evaluated for the presence of the most
      commonly found β-lactamases and ESBLs in clinical settings (bla (CTX-M)
      groups 1, 2, and 9, bla (CMY), bla (SHV), and bla (TEM)) and
      carbapenemases (bla (IMP), bla (KPC), bla (NDM), bla (OXA), bla (SFC1),
      bla (VIM)) through multiplex PCR. A total of eight strains were determined
      to contain one or more genes of interest. Phenotypic resistance to 18
      antimicrobial agents was assessed and isolates were subjected to whole
      genome sequencing through a combination of Oxford Nanopore's MinION and
      Illumina's MiSeq. Results revealed the presence of β-lactamase and
      ESBL-producing Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Stenotrophomonas
      maltophilia, and a Paraburkholderia spp. Identified β-lactamases and ESBLs
      include bla (CTX-M), bla (TEM), bla (CMY), bla (SHV) and a possible bla
      (KPC)-like gene, with both documented and novel sequences established. In
      addition, two inducible β-lactamases were found, a class A β-lactamase
      (L1) and a cephalosporinase (L2). All strains were determined to be
      multidrug resistant and numerous resistance genes to non-β-lactams were
      observed. In conclusion, this study demonstrates that environmental
      sources are a potential reservoir of clinically relevant ESBL-producing
      bacteria that may pose a health risk to humans upon exposure.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Ceftazidime/avibactam (CAZ-AVI), approved in 2015, is an
      important first-line option for Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (KPC-E). Although still uncommon,
      resistance to CAZ-AVI has emerged and may represent a serious cause of
      concern. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature review of clinical
      and microbiological features of infections and colonisations by
      CAZ-AVI-resistant KPC-E, focused on the in vivo emergence of CAZ-AVI
      resistance in different clinical scenarios. RESULTS: Twenty-three papers
      were retrieved accounting for 42 patients and 57 isolates, mostly
      belonging to K. pneumoniae ST258 harbouring D179Y substitution in the KPC
      enzyme. The USA, Greece and Italy accounted for 80% of cases. In one-third
      of isolates resistance was not associated with previous CAZ-AVI exposure.
      Moreover, 20% of the strains were colistin-resistant and 80% were
      extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-producers. The majority of infected
      patients had severe underlying diseases (39% cancer, 22% solid-organ
      transplantation) and 37% died. The abdomen, lung and blood were the most
      involved infection sites. Infections by CAZ-AVI-resistant strains were
      mainly treated with combination therapy (85% of cases), with meropenem
      being the most common (65%) followed by tigecycline (30%), gentamicin
      (25%), colistin (25%) and fosfomycin (10%). Despite the emergence of
      resistance, 35% of patients received CAZ-AVI. CONCLUSION: Taken together,
      these data highlight the need for prompt susceptibility testing including
      CAZ-AVI for Enterobacterales, at least in critical areas. Resistance to
      CAZ-AVI is an urgent issue to monitor in order to improve both empirical
      and targeted CAZ-AVI use as well as the management of patients with
      infections caused by CAZ-AVI-resistant strains.

AB  - The emerging spread of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE)
      strains, in particular, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli, has
      become a significant threat to hospitalized patients. Carbapenemase genes
      are frequently located on plasmids than can be exchanged among clonal
      strains, increasing the antibiotic resistance rate. The aim of this study
      was to determine the prevalence of CPE in patients upon their admission
      and to analyze selected associated factors. An investigation of the
      antibiotic resistance and genetic features of circulating CPE was carried
      out. Phenotypic tests and molecular typing were performed on 48
      carbapenemase-producing strains of K. pneumoniae and E. coli collected
      from rectal swabs of adult patients. Carbapenem-resistance was confirmed
      by PCR detection of resistance genes. All strains were analyzed by
      PCR-based replicon typing (PBRT) and multilocus sequence typing (MLST) was
      performed on a representative isolate of each PBRT profile. More than 50%
      of the strains were found to be multidrug-resistant, and the bla (KPC)
      gene was detected in all the isolates with the exception of an E. coli
      strain. A multireplicon status was observed, and the most prevalent
      profile was FIIK, FIB KQ (33%). MLST analysis revealed the prevalence of
      sequence type 512 (ST512). This study highlights the importance of
      screening patients upon their admission to limit the spread of CRE in
      hospitals.

AB  - In order to evaluate whether seagulls living on the Lisbon coastline,
      Portugal, might be colonized and consequently represent potential
      spreaders of multidrug-resistant bacteria, a total of 88 gull fecal
      samples were screened for detection of extended-spectrum β-lactamase
      (ESBL)- or carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae for
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and for
      vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE). A large proportion of samples
      yielded carbapenemase- or ESBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae (16% and 55%,
      respectively), while only two MRSA and two VRE were detected. Mating-out
      assays followed by PCR and whole-plasmid sequencing allowed to identify
      carbapenemase and ESBL encoding genes. Among 24 carbapenemase-producing
      isolates, there were mainly Klebsiella pneumoniae (50%) and Escherichia
      coli (33%). OXA-181 was the most common carbapenemase identified (54%),
      followed by OXA-48 (25%) and KPC-2 (17%). Ten different ESBLs were found
      among 62 ESBL-producing isolates, mainly being CTX-M-type enzymes (87%).
      Co-occurrence in single samples of multiple ESBL- and carbapenemase
      producers belonging to different bacterial species was observed in some
      cases. Seagulls constitute an important source for spreading
      multidrug-resistant bacteria in the environment and their gut microbiota a
      formidable microenvironment for transfer of resistance genes within
      bacterial species.

AB  - 72 clinical strains of Klebsiella spp. isolated from samples obtained from
      humans in Novosibirsk, Russia, were analyzed. Species identification of
      strains was performed using 16S rRNA and rpoB gene sequences. It was
      revealed that Klebsiella pneumoniae strains were dominant in the
      population (57 strains), while the remaining 15 strains were K. grimontii,
      K. aerogenes, K. oxytoca and K. quasipneumoniae. By molecular serotyping
      using the wzi gene sequence, K. pneumoniae strains were assigned to
      twenty-one K-serotypes with a high proportion of virulent K1- and
      K2-serotypes. It was found that K. pneumoniae strains isolated from the
      hospitalized patients had a higher resistance to antibiotics compared to
      the other Klebsiella species. Real-time PCR revealed that the population
      contained genes of the blaSHV, blaTEM, blaCTX families and the blaOXA-48
      gene, which are the genetic determinants of beta-lactam resistance. It has
      been shown that the presence of the blaCTX sequence correlated with the
      production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases, and phenotypic resistance
      to carbapenems is due to the presence of the blaOXA-48 gene. At the same
      time, the carbapenemase genes vim, ndm, kpc, imp were not detected. Among
      the aminoglycoside resistance genes studied, the aph(6)-Id and aadA genes
      were found, but their presence did not always coincide with phenotypic
      resistance. Resistance to fluoroquinolones in the vast majority of strains
      was accompanied by the presence of the aac(6')-IB-cr, oqxA, oqxB, qnrB,
      and qnrS genes in various combinations, while the presence of the oqxA
      and/or oqxB genes alone did not correlate with resistance to
      fluoroquinolones. Thus, the detection of blaCTX and blaOXA-48 can be used
      to quickly predict the production of extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and
      to determine the resistance of Klebsiella to carbapenems. The detection of
      the aac(6')-Ib-cr and/or qnrB/qnrS genes can be used to quickly determine
      resistance to fluoroquinolones.

AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae appears as one of the most prevalent pathogens among
      cancer patients. The present study investigates the clinical,
      epidemiological and microbiological aspects related to infections caused
      by K. pneumoniae in cancer patients treated at an oncology referral center
      in the state of Pará, Amazon region, Brazil. Between July 2017 to July
      2019, an epidemiological, observational, cross-sectional study, with a
      descriptive and analytical approach was conducted, including patients with
      confirmed diagnosis of cancer who acquired infection by K. pneumoniae 72 h
      after hospital admission. K. pneumoniae isolates included in the study
      were obtained from different clinical materials (blood, urine, catheter
      tip and bladder catheter, orotracheal secretions, oncological and surgical
      wounds). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing and molecular detection of
      the carbapenemase-encoding genes were performed. A high prevalence of MDR
      K. pneumoniae isolates was observed, including two colistin-resistant
      isolates and seven isolates harboring bla(KPC-1) gene. To conclude, our
      findings provide the firsts insights into the epidemiology and infection
      by K. pneumoniae in the state of Pará, Brazil, and may be useful on
      treatment guidance and establishment of strategies to control the spread
      of resistance strains of K. pneumoniae in the region.

AB  - Genome sequences provide information on the genetic elements present in an
      organism, and currently there are databases containing hundreds of
      thousands of bacterial genome sequences. These repositories allow for
      mining patterns concerning antibiotic resistance gene occurrence in both
      pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria in e.g. natural or animal
      environments, and link these to relevant metadata such as bacterial host
      species, country and year of isolation, and co-occurrence with other
      resistance genes. In addition, the advances in the prediction of mobile
      genetic elements, and discerning chromosomal from plasmid DNA, broadens
      our view on the mechanism mediating dissemination. In this study we
      utilize the vast amount of data in the public database PATRIC to
      investigate the dissemination of carbapenemase-encoding genes (CEGs), the
      emergence and spread of which is considered a grave public health concern.
      Based on publicly available genome sequences from PATRIC and manually
      curated CEG sequences from the beta lactam database, we found 7,964
      bacterial genomes, belonging to at least 70 distinct species, that carry
      in total 9,892 CEGs, amongst which bla (NDM), bla (OXA), bla (VIM), bla
      (IMP) and bla (KPC). We were able to distinguish between chromosomally
      located resistance genes (4,137; 42%) and plasmid-located resistance genes
      (5,753; 58%). We found that a large proportion of the identified CEGs were
      identical, i.e. displayed 100% nucleotide similarity in multiple bacterial
      species (8,361 out of 9,892 genes; 85%). For example, the New Delhi
      metallo-beta-lactamase NDM-1 was found in 42 distinct bacterial species,
      and present in seven different environments. Our data show the extent of
      carbapenem-resistance far beyond the canonical species Acetinobacter
      baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. These types of
      data complement previous systematic reviews, in which carbapenem-resistant
      Enterobacteriaceae were found in wildlife, livestock and companion
      animals. Considering the widespread distribution of CEGs, we see a need
      for comprehensive surveillance and transmission studies covering more host
      species and environments, akin to previous extensive surveys that focused
      on extended spectrum beta-lactamases. This may help to fully appreciate
      the spread of CEGs and improve the understanding of mechanisms underlying
      transmission, which could lead to interventions minimizing transmission to
      humans.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Infections caused by drug-resistant Enterobacterales including
      those producing metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) are particularly challenging
      due to limited therapeutic options. The drug combination
      aztreonam/avibactam (ATM-AVI) is under clinical development for treating
      serious infections caused by these strains. This study assessed the in
      vitro activity of ATM-AVI against Enterobacterales isolates collected
      globally in the ATLAS surveillance programme in 2019. METHODS: Clinical
      isolates of Enterobacterales (N = 18 713) including Citrobacter freundii,
      Citrobacter koseri, Enterobacter cloacae complex, Escherichia coli,
      Klebsiella aerogenes, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus
      mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens collected from 232 sites in 2019 were
      analysed. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by reference
      broth microdilution. A pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic based breakpoint of
      8 mg/L was considered for ATM-AVI activity. RESULTS: ATM-AVI demonstrated
      potent antimicrobial activity against all Enterobacterales, with 99.9%
      isolates inhibited at MIC ≤8 mg/L (MIC(90), 0.25 mg/L). MICs ≤8 mg/L
      (>99.0%) were noted for ATM-AVI across regions worldwide. Among other
      antimicrobials, amikacin, colistin, imipenem, meropenem, and tigecycline
      were also active (susceptibility >85.0%) against Enterobacterales.
      Activity of ATM-AVI was sustained against multidrug-resistant,
      extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing, and carbapenem-resistant isolates
      (susceptibility >99%; MIC(90), 0.25-0.5 mg/L). Importantly, potent
      activity for ATM-AVI (>99.0%; MIC(90,) 0.5 mg/L) was noted among
      MBL-positive isolates and those producing other carbapenemases, such as
      KPC and OXA-48. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that ATM-AVI was
      highly active against a recent collection of Enterobacterales isolates,
      including those producing MBLs either alone or in combination with other
      carbapenemases. Thus, ATM-AVI represents a potential option for treating
      infections caused by antibiotic-resistant Enterobacterales including
      MBL-producing strains.

AB  - Ceftazidime/avibactam uniquely demonstrates activity against both KPC and
      OXA-48-like carbapenemase-expressing Enterobacterales. Clinical resistance
      to ceftazidime/avibactam in KPC-producers was foreseen in in-vitro
      resistance studies. Herein, we assessed the resistance selection
      propensity of ceftazidime/avibactam in K. pneumoniae expressing
      OXA-48-like β-lactamases (n = 10), employing serial transfer approach.
      Ceftazidime/avibactam MICs (0.25-4 mg/L) increased to 16-256 mg/L after 15
      daily-sequential transfers. The whole genome sequence analysis of terminal
      mutants showed modifications in proteins linked to efflux
      (AcrB/AcrD/EmrA/Mdt), outer membrane permeability (OmpK36) and/or stress
      response pathways (CpxA/EnvZ/RpoE). In-vitro growth properties of all the
      ceftazidime/avibactam-selected mutants were comparable to their respective
      parents and they retained the ability to cause pulmonary infection in
      neutropenic mice. Against these mutants, we explored the activities of
      various combinations of β-lactams (ceftazidime or cefepime) with
      structurally diverse β-lactamase inhibitors or a β-lactam enhancer,
      zidebactam. Zidebactam, in combination with either cefepime or
      ceftazidime, overcame ceftazidime/avibactam resistance (MIC range 0.5-8
      mg/L), while cefepime/avibactam was the second best (MIC: 0.5-16 mg/L) in
      yielding lower MICs. The present work revealed the possibility of
      ceftazidime/avibactam resistance in OXA-48-like K. pneumoniae through
      mutations in proteins involved in efflux and/or porins without concomitant
      fitness cost mandating astute monitoring of ceftazidime/avibactam
      resistance among OXA-48 genotypes.

AB  - Introduction: Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a common and
      potentially fatal complication of mechanical ventilation that is often
      caused by multidrug-resistant (MDR) Gram-negative bacteria (GNB). Despite
      the repurposing of older treatments and the novel antimicrobials, many
      resistance mechanisms cannot be confronted, and novel therapies are
      needed.Areas covered: We searched the literature for keywords regarding
      the treatment of GNB infections in mechanically ventilated patients. This
      narrative review presents new data on antibiotics and non-antibiotic
      approaches focusing on Phase 3 trials against clinically significant GNB
      that cause VAP.Expert opinion: Ceftazidime-avibactam,
      meropenem-vaborbactam, and imipenem-relebactam stand out as new options
      for infections by Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing bacteria,
      whereas ceftolozane-tazobactam adds therapeutic flexibility in Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa infections with multiple resistance mechanisms.
      Ceftazidime-avibactam and ceftolozane-tazobactam have relevant literature.
      Aztreonam-avibactam holds promise for the treatment of infections by
      metallo-β-lactamase (MBL)-producing organisms. Recently approved
      cefiderocol possesses an extended antibacterial spectrum, including KPC-
      and MBL-producers. However, recently published data have toned down
      optimism about treating VAP caused by carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter
      baumannii. For the latter, eravacycline may provide additional hope,
      pending pertinent data. Non-antibiotic treatments currently being
      considered as adjunct therapeutic approaches are welcome. Nevertheless,
      they will hopefully substitute current antimicrobials in the future.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We compared the activity of 8 novel β-lactam and
      tetracycline-derivative antibiotics against a cohort of clinical
      carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) isolates and investigated the
      incremental susceptibility benefit of the addition of an aminoglycoside,
      fluoroquinolone, or polymyxin to the β-lactam agents to assist with
      empiric antibiotic decision making. METHODS: A collection of consecutive
      CRE clinical isolates from unique patients at 3 US hospitals (2016-2021)
      was assembled. Broth microdilution was performed to obtain antimicrobial
      susceptibility testing results. Mechanisms of carbapenem resistance were
      investigated through short-read and long-read whole-genome sequencing.
      RESULTS: Of the 603 CRE isolates, 276 (46%) were carbapenemase producing
      and 327 (54%) were non-carbapenemase producing, respectively. The
      organisms most frequently identified were Klebsiella pneumoniae (38%),
      Enterobacter cloacae complex (26%), and Escherichia coli (16%). We
      obtained the following percent susceptibility to novel β-lactam agents:
      ceftazidime-avibactam (95%), meropenem-vaborbactam (92%),
      imipenem-relebactam (84%), and cefiderocol (92%). Aminoglycosides and the
      polymyxins provided greater incremental coverage as second agents,
      compared to fluoroquinolones. Amikacin and plazomicin exhibited the
      greatest additive value. Ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, and
      cefiderocol were active against 94% of the 220 KPC-producing isolates.
      Cefiderocol was active against 83% of the 29 NDM-producing isolates.
      Ceftazidime-avibactam had 100% activity against the 9
      OXA-48-like-producing isolates. Tigecycline had the highest activity
      compared to other tetracyclines against KPC, NDM, or OXA-48-like-producing
      isolates. CONCLUSION: Selection among novel agents requires a nuanced
      understanding of the molecular epidemiology of CRE. This work provides
      insights into the comparative activity of novel agents and the additive
      value of a second antibiotic for empiric antibiotic decision making.

AB  - Among Enterobacterales, Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) is one of the major
      opportunistic pathogens causing hospital-acquired infections. The most
      problematic phenomenon linked to Kp is related to the dissemination of
      multi-drug resistant (MDR) clones producing carbapenem-hydrolyzing
      enzymes, representing a clinical and public health threat at a global
      scale. Over the past decades, high-risk MDR clones (e.g., ST512, ST307,
      ST101 producing bla (KPC-type) carbepenemases) have become endemic in
      several countries, including Italy. Concurrently, the spread of highly
      virulent Kp lineages (e.g., ST23, ST86) able to cause severe,
      community-acquired, pyogenic infections with metastatic dissemination in
      immunocompetent subjects has started to be documented. These clones,
      designated as hypervirulent Kp (hvKp), produce an extensive array of
      virulence factors and are highly virulent in previously validated animal
      models. While the prevalence and distribution of MDR Kp has been
      previously assessed at local and national level knowledge about
      dissemination of hvKp remains scarce. In this work, we studied the
      phenotypic and genotypic features of hypermucoviscous (HMV, as possible
      marker of increased virulence) Kp isolates from bloodstream infections
      (BSI), obtained in 2016-17 from 43 Italian Laboratories. Antimicrobial
      susceptibility testing, whole genome sequencing and the use of two animal
      models (G. mellonella and murine) were employed to characterize collected
      isolates. Over 1502 BSI recorded in the study period, a total of 19 Kp
      were selected for further investigation based on their HMV phenotype.
      Results showed that hvKp isolates (ST5, ST8, ST11, ST25) are circulating
      in Italy, although with a low prevalence and in absence of a clonal
      expansion; convergence of virulence (yersiniabactin and/or salmochelin,
      aerobactin, regulators of mucoid phenotype) and antimicrobial-resistance
      (extended-spectrum beta-lactamases) features was observed in some cases.
      Conventional MDR Kp clones (ST307, ST512) may exhibit an HMV phenotype,
      but with a low virulence potential in the animal models. To the best of
      our knowledge, this work represents the first systematic survey on HMV and
      hvKp in Italy, employing a functional characterization of collected
      isolates. Future surveillance programs are warranted to monitor the
      threatening convergence of virulence and resistance among MDR Kp and the
      spread of hvKp.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the antimicrobial activities of ceftazidime/avibactam
      (CAZ/AVI) and aztreonam/avibactam (ATM/AVI) against carbapenem-resistant
      Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) isolates collected from three secondary hospitals
      in Southwest China between 2018 and 2019. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total
      of 120 unique CRE clinical isolates were collected and carbapenemase genes
      were detected using PCR. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using
      standard broth microdilution method and the results were interpreted
      according to CLSI breakpoints. RESULTS: The 120 carbapenem-resistant
      strains included 92 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 10 Escherichia coli, 10
      Enterobacter cloacae, five Klebsiella aerogenes, and three Klebsiella
      oxytoca isolates. Seventy-four percent of these 120 CRE isolates were
      collected from patients located in non-ICUs; 65.0% of these CRE isolates
      were collected from male patients; and 34.2% of these isolates were
      isolated from respiratory tracts. Four different carbapenemase genes were
      identified among 103 carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE)
      isolates, including bla (KPC-2) (n=77), bla (NDM-1) (n=16), bla (NDM-5)
      (n=12) and bla (IMP-4) (n=2). Overall, 21.7%, 37.5%, 40.8%, 75.0%, and
      100% of the CRE strains were susceptible to levofloxacin,
      trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, amikacin, CAZ/AVI, and ATM/AVI,
      respectively. In addition, antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed
      that 96.7% isolates (n=116) were resistant to aztreonam, and the addition
      of avibactam (4 mg/L) significantly reduced the MICs of those
      aztreonam-resistant isolates by more than 128-fold (range: ≤0.125-4 mg/L),
      and 90.0% (n=108) of total 120 isolates were inhibited at ATM/AVI
      concentration ≤1 mg/L. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed significant
      antimicrobial resistance among the CRE isolates against some commonly used
      antibiotics in three secondary Chinese hospitals. ATM/AVI exhibited potent
      activity against CRE isolates, including double carbapenemase-producing
      isolates, whereas CAZ/AVI was active against all KPC producers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies describing the activity of imipenem/relebactam against
      gram-negative bacilli (GNB) isolated from pediatric patients are lacking
      in the peer-reviewed literature. We address this deficiency by reporting
      on GNB tested against imipenem/relebactam as part of the Study for
      Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends global surveillance program.
      METHODS: In 2015-2017, 221 laboratories in 59 countries collected 9149
      consecutive, aerobic or facultative GNB from pediatric patients (age <18
      years) and 100 785 from adult patients with intraabdominal, respiratory,
      and urinary tract infections. Susceptibility was determined using Clinical
      and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution methodology
      and CLSI breakpoints (and US Food and Drug Administration breakpoints for
      imipenem/relebactam). RESULTS: The 4 most common species of GNB isolated
      from pediatric patients were Escherichia coli (40.4%), Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa (17.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.9%), and Enterobacter
      cloacae (4.7%); non-Morganellaceae Enterobacterales (NME) accounted for
      70.1% of isolates. Imipenem/relebactam inhibited 97.8% of NME from
      pediatric patients; susceptibility to imipenem was 1.9% lower, and
      susceptibility to β-lactam comparators (cefepime, ceftazidime,
      ceftriaxone, piperacillin/tazobactam) was 9.2-25.2% lower.
      Imipenem/relebactam inhibited 94.2% of P. aeruginosa from pediatric
      patients; susceptibility to imipenem was 16.2% lower, and susceptibility
      to β-lactam comparators was 10.2-15.6% lower. Susceptibility was generally
      slightly higher for isolates from pediatric than adult patients. All K.
      pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-positive isolates, 93.3% of
      multidrug-resistant (MDR) NME isolates, and 70.5% of MDR P. aeruginosa
      isolates from pediatric patients were susceptible to imipenem/relebactam.
      CONCLUSIONS: Imipenem/relebactam provides a new treatment option for
      infections caused by resistant gram-negative bacilli, including
      KPC-positive NME, MDR NME, and MDR P. aeruginosa.

AB  - Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) have been heavily linked
      to hospital acquired infections (HAI) thereby leading to futility of
      antibiotics in treating infections and this have complicated public health
      problems. There is little knowledge about carbapenemase-producing
      Klebsiella spp. (CPK) in South Africa. This study aimed at determining the
      occurrence of CPK in different samples collected from selected
      environmental niches (hospitals, wastewater treatment plants, rivers,
      farms) in three district municipalities located in the Eastern Cape
      Province, South Africa. Molecular identification and characterization of
      the presumptive isolates were determined using polymerase chain reaction
      (PCR) and isolates that exhibited phenotypic carbapenem resistance were
      further screened for the possibility of harbouring antimicrobial
      resistance genes. One hundred (43%) of the 234 confirmed Klebsiella spp.
      isolates harboured carbapenem-resistance genes; 10 isolates harboured
      bla(OXA-48-like); 17 harboured bla(KPC); and 73 isolates harboured
      bla(NDM-1). The emergence of bla(KPC), bla(OXA-48-like), and bla(NDM-1)
      carbapenem-resistance genes in Klebsiella species associated with
      environmental sources is of great concern to public health.

AB  - The natural environment represents a complex reservoir of
      antibiotic-resistant bacteria as a consequence of different wastewater
      discharges including anthropogenic and agricultural. Therefore, the aim of
      this study was to examine sewage and waters across Ireland for the
      presence of antibiotic-resistant Enterobacterales. Samples were collected
      from the West, East and South of Ireland. Two periods of sampling took
      place between July 2019 and November 2020, during which 118 water (30 L)
      and 36 sewage samples (200 mL) were collected. Waters were filtered using
      the CapE method, followed by enrichment and culturing. Sewage samples were
      directly cultured on selective agars. Isolates were identified by
      MALDI-TOF and antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed in
      accordance with EUCAST criteria. Selected isolates were examined for
      bla(CTX-M), bla(VIM), bla(IMP), bla(OXA-48), bla(NDM), and bla(KPC) by
      real time PCR and whole genome sequencing (n = 146). A total of 419
      Enterobacterales (348 water, 71 sewage) were isolated from all samples.
      Hospital sewage isolates displayed the highest percentage resistance to
      many beta-lactam and aminoglycoside antibiotics. Extended-spectrum
      beta-lactamase-producers were identified in 78% of water and 50% of sewage
      samples. One or more carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales were
      identified at 23 individual sampling sites (18 water, 5 sewage). This
      included the detection of bla(OXA-48) (n = 18), bla(NDM) (n = 14),
      bla(KPC) (n = 4) and bla(OXA-484) (n = 1). All NDM-producing isolates
      harbored the ble-MBL bleomycin resistance gene. Commonly detected sequence
      types included Klebsiella ST323, ST17, and ST405 as well as E. coli ST131,
      ST38 and ST10. Core genome MLST comparisons detected identical E. coli
      isolates from wastewater treatment plant (WWTP) influent and nursing home
      sewage, and the surrounding waters. Similarly, one Klebsiella pneumoniae
      isolated from WWTP influent and the surrounding estuarine water were
      identical. These results highlight the need for regular monitoring of the
      aquatic environment for the presence of antibiotic-resistant organisms to
      adequately inform public health policies.

AB  - PURPOSE: Clinical mass spectrometry requires a simple step process for
      sample preparation. This study aims to optimize the method for isolating
      periplasmic protein from Gram-negative bacteria and apply to clinical mass
      spectrometry. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: The Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase
      (KPC)-producing E. coli standard cells were used for optimizing the
      osmotic shock (OS) lysis method. The supernatant from OS lysis was
      analysed by LC-MS/MS and MALDI-TOF MS. The effectiveness of the OS lysis
      method for KPC-2-producing Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates were then
      confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS. RESULTS: The optimized OS lysis using KPC-2
      producing E. coli standard cells showed a high yield of KPC-2 protein and
      enriches periplasmic proteins. Compared with other lysis methods, the
      detection sensitivity of KPC-2 protein significantly increased in
      MALDI-TOF MS analysis. Nineteen clinical isolates were validated by
      MALDI-TOF MS using the OS method, which also showed higher detection
      sensitivity compared to other lysis method (e.g., 1.5%
      n-octyl-β-D-glucopyranoside) (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL
      RELEVANCE: This study provides a straightforward, rapid, affordable, and
      detergent-free method for the analysis of periplasmic proteins from
      Enterobacteriaceae clinical isolates. This approach may contribute to
      MS-based clinical diagnostics.

AB  - PURPOSE: Carbapenems are considered the most efficient antibiotic used in
      the treatment of nosocomial infections. Carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative
      rods are becoming a serious hazard in hospitals threatening public health.
      The aim of the current study was to investigate the prevalence of
      carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative pathogens incriminated in
      healthcare-associated infections, along with antimicrobial resistance
      profiles, carbapenemase and metallo-β-lactamase production, and their
      molecular characterization. METHODS: A total of 186 clinical specimens
      were collected from 133 patients at various hospitals in Cairo, Egypt. The
      obtained specimens were subjected to bacteriological examination,
      antimicrobial susceptibility testing, detection of carbapenemase
      production using the modified Hodge test (MHT), the metallo-β-lactamase
      production using the EDTA combined disc test (CDT), and PCR-based
      detection of the bla (KPC) and bla (GES) resistance genes. The
      identification of the highly resistant retrieved isolates was then
      confirmed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. RESULTS: The most common isolated
      Gram-negative species was Klebsiella pneumoniae (40.9%), followed by
      Acinetobacter baumannii (18.8%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (17.3%),
      Escherichia coli (15.4%), Enterobacter aerogenes (5.3%), and Proteus
      mirabilis (2.4%). The prevalence of carbapenem-resistant isolates was
      36.1% (n=75). However, 86.5% of the recovered clinical isolates were
      susceptible to colistin. The MHT revealed that 33.6% (n=70) of the tested
      strains were positive for carbapenemase production, while the CDT showed
      that 33.17% (n=69) of the examined strains were metallo-β-lactamase
      producers. The PCR revealed that 98.6% (74/75) of the tested strains
      possessed the bla (KPC) gene; moreover, 97.3% (73/75) of the examined
      strains harbored the bla (GES) gene. CONCLUSION: This study displayed the
      emergence of carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative pathogens incriminated in
      healthcare-associated infections. The accurate identification of
      carbapenem-resistant bacterial pathogens is pivotal for the treatment of
      patients, in addition to propelling appropriate contamination control
      measures to restrain the fast spread of such pathogens. Colistin showed a
      potent in vitro antimicrobial activity against the carbapenem-resistant
      strains.

AB  - Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRK) infections are a growing
      concern in immunocompromised patients. The aim of the present study was to
      evaluate the impact of CRK colonization and infection in overall mortality
      for haematopoietic stem-cell transplant (HSCT) patients. We also aimed to
      investigate resistance and virulence profiles of CRK isolates and assess
      their epidemiological and genetic relatedness. Patients in the HSCT unit
      were screened for colonization with CRK with weekly rectal swab or stool
      cultures and placed under contact precautions. We defined CRK colonization
      as positive culture from a swab or stool sample grown in MacConkey agar
      with meropenem at 1 µg ml(-1). Demographic and clinical data were
      retrieved from the patients' charts and electronic records. According to
      resistance mechanisms and pulsed field gel electrophoresis profile,
      isolates were selected based on whole-genome sequencing (WGS) using MiSeq
      Illumina. Outcomes were defined as overall mortality (death up to D+100),
      and infection-related death (within 14 days of infection). We report a
      retrospective cohort of 569 haematopoietic stem-cell transplant patients
      with 105 (18.4 %) CRK colonizations and 30 (5.3 %) infections. blaKPC was
      the most frequent carbapenemase in our cohort with three isolates
      co-harbouring blaKPC and blaNDM. We found no difference in virulence
      profiles from the CRK isolates. There were also no significant differences
      in virulence profiles among colonization and infection isolates regarding
      genes encoding for type 1 and 3 fimbriae, siderophores, lipopolysaccharide
      and colibactin. In clonality analysis by PFGE and WGS, isolates were
      polyclonal and ST340 was the most prevalent. Overall survival at D+100 was
      75.4 % in in CRK-colonized (P=0.02) and 35.7 % in infected patients and
      significantly lower than non-colonized patients (85.8 %; P<0.001). We
      found a higher overall mortality associated with colonization and
      infection; KPC was the main resistance mechanism for carbapenems. The
      polyclonal distribution of isolates and findings of CRK infection in
      patients not previously colonized suggest the need to reinforce antibiotic
      stewardship.

AB  - The limited armamentarium against drug-resistant Gram-negative bacilli has
      led to the development of several novel β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor
      combinations (BLBLIs). In this review, we summarize their spectrum of in
      vitro activities, mechanisms of resistance, and
      pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic (PK-PD) characteristics. A summary of
      available clinical data is provided per drug. Four approved BLBLIs are
      discussed in detail. All are options for treating multidrug-resistant
      (MDR) Enterobacterales and Pseudomonas aeruginosa Ceftazidime-avibactam is
      a potential drug for treating Enterobacterales producing extended-spectrum
      β-lactamase (ESBL), Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC), AmpC, and
      some class D β-lactamases (OXA-48) in addition to carbapenem-resistant
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa Ceftolozane-tazobactam is a treatment option mainly
      for carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (non-carbapenemase producing), with
      some activity against ESBL-producing Enterobacterales
      Meropenem-vaborbactam has emerged as treatment option for Enterobacterales
      producing ESBL, KPC, or AmpC, with similar activity as meropenem against
      P. aeruginosa Imipenem-relebactam has documented activity against
      Enterobacterales producing ESBL, KPC, and AmpC, with the combination
      having some additional activity against P. aeruginosa relative to
      imipenem. None of these drugs present in vitro activity against
      Enterobacterales or P. aeruginosa producing metallo-β-lactamase (MBL) or
      against carbapenemase-producing Acinetobacter baumannii Clinical data
      regarding the use of these drugs to treat MDR bacteria are limited and
      rely mostly on nonrandomized studies. An overview on eight BLBLIs in
      development is also provided. These drugs provide various levels of in
      vitro coverage of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales, with several
      drugs presenting in vitro activity against MBLs (cefepime-zidebactam,
      aztreonam-avibactam, meropenem-nacubactam, and cefepime-taniborbactam).
      Among these drugs, some also present in vitro activity against
      carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa (cefepime-zidebactam and
      cefepime-taniborbactam) and A. baumannii (cefepime-zidebactam and
      sulbactam-durlobactam).

AB  - OBJECTIVES: WCK 4282, high-dose cefepime/tazobactam, possesses potent in
      vitro activity against Gram-negative organisms including ESBL- and
      cephalosporinase-harbouring strains. The purpose of this evaluation was to
      investigate the in vivo activity of human-simulated exposures of WCK 4282
      against serine-β-lactamase-harbouring Enterobacterales and Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa. METHODS: Nineteen clinical isolates were evaluated
      (ESBL/cephalosporinase producers, n = 8 Escherichia coli, n = 4 P.
      aeruginosa; KPC producers, n = 3 Klebsiella pneumoniae, n = 1 Klebsiella
      aerogenes; OXA-48/181 producers, n = 2 K. pneumoniae, n = 1 E. coli). WCK
      4282 MICs ranged from 4 to 32 mg/L compared with 16 to >128 mg/L for
      cefepime. Thigh-infected neutropenic mice received cefepime, WCK 4282 or
      sham control over 24 h prior to harvest. Cefepime and tazobactam dosing
      regimens produced plasma profiles of fAUC, fT>MIC and fCmax similar to
      human exposure after WCK 4282 2/2 g every 8 h (1.5 h infusion). RESULTS:
      Bacterial burdens (log10 cfu/thigh) were 5.81 ± 0.36 at 0 h and 9.29 ±
      0.88 at 24 h in untreated controls. WCK 4282 produced potent activity
      against ESBL/cephalosporinase-producing strains with WCK 4282 MIC ≤16
      mg/L; mean changes in log10 cfu/thigh from 0 h were -1.70 ± 0.77 and +1.86
      ± 2.03 log10 cfu/thigh for WCK 4282 and cefepime human-simulated regimens,
      respectively. WCK 4282 produced variable activity against
      serine-carbapenemase-harbouring isolates. For the KPC-harbouring strains,
      WCK 4282 produced bacteriostasis with a mean -0.1 ± 0.61 log10 cfu/thigh.
      Against OXA-48/181-harbouring isolates, WCK 4282 produced a range of
      change in bacterial burden of -1.23 ± 0.33 to +1.04 ± 0.7 log10 cfu/thigh.
      CONCLUSIONS: Human-simulated exposures of WCK 4282 produced in vivo
      efficacy against ESBL/cephalosporinase-producing, piperacillin/tazobactam-
      and ceftolozane/tazobactam-non-susceptible Enterobacterales and P.
      aeruginosa. These findings support further development of this combination
      as a carbapenem-sparing agent.

AB  - Meropenem/vaborbactam (MV) and cefiderocol were recently approved by the
      Food and Drug Administration and European Medicines Agency and are among
      the most promising antibacterial in treatment regimens against multi-drug
      resistant (MDR) gram-negative bacilli. A survey with close-ended questions
      was proposed to infectious disease (ID) and intensive care unit (ICU)
      physicians of Piedmont and Valle d'Aosta Region's hospitals. The aim was
      to collect data about habits and prescriptions of cefiderocol and MV.
      Twenty-three physicians (11 ID specialists and 12 anesthesiologists) in 13
      Italian hospitals took part in the survey. Both cefiderocol and MV were
      mostly used as target therapy after a previous treatment failure and after
      ID specialist consult. The most frequent MDR pathogen in hospitals was
      Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing bacteria (KPC), followed by
      P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. MDRs were more frequently isolated in ICU.
      In conclusion, cefiderocol was used in empiric regimens when A.baumannii
      was suspected, while MV was more used in suspect of KPC. MV and
      cefiderocol can be the first option in empiric treatment for critically
      ill patients in settings with high risk of MDR. The treatment should then
      be followed by rapid de-escalation when microbiological results are
      available.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In the present study, our aim was to evaluate the clinical and
      microbiological characteristics of a cohort of patients with bloodstream
      infections (BSI) due to Carbapenem-Resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) and
      investigate the independent predictors of mortality. METHODS: All episodes
      of carbapenem-resistant E. coli (CREc) or K. pneumoniae (CRKp) BSI that
      were subject to a mandatory notification from January to December 2020 in
      all acute care hospitals and long-term care facilities of the Campania
      region in southern Italy were enrolled. All carbapenem-resistant strains
      were assessed through molecular tests for the presence of five
      carbapenemase gene families, i.e., K. pneumoniae Carbapenemase (KPC),
      oxacillinase-48 (OXA-48), New Delhi Metallo-β-lactamase (NDM), Verona
      integron encoded metallo-β-lactamase (VIM) and Imipenemase (IMP). RESULTS:
      During the study period, a total of 154 consecutive non-repeated CRE BSI,
      all due to CRKp, were reported. The most frequently identified genes were
      KPC in 108 cases (70.1%), followed by metallo-betalactamases (MBL)
      (16.2%), and OXA-48 (2.6%); in 17 isolates (11%) no carbapenemase was
      detected. The overall mortality at 90 days was 41.9%. Using a log-rank
      test, patients without risk factors for CRE infections showed a
      significantly lower cumulative mortality (p = 0.001). After multivariate
      logistic regression analysis, the presence of at least one risk factor was
      the only predictor of mortality (OR: 1.7, 95% CI 1.2-6.1, p = 0.015).
      CONCLUSIONS: The study reported a non-negligible prevalence of
      MBL-producing organisms among CRKp isolated from blood cultures in our
      region. This data highlights the importance of molecular characterization
      of all clinical isolates of carbapenem-resistant organisms.

CY  - Switzerland
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In intensive care units (ICUs), carbapenem-resistant
      Enterobacterales (CRE) pose a significant threat. We aimed to examine the
      distribution, epidemiological characteristics, and risk factors for CRE
      positivity in ICUs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was
      conducted in 96 ICUs of 78 hospitals in Henan Province, China. The
      clinical and microbiological data were collected. A multivariable logistic
      regression model was used to analyze the risk factors for CRE positivity.
      RESULTS: A total of 1,009 patients were enrolled. There was a significant
      difference in CRE positive rate between pharyngeal and anal swabs (15.16
      vs. 19.13%, P < 0.001). A total of 297 carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella
      pneumoniae (CR-KPN), 22 carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli (CR-ECO), 6
      carbapenem-resistant Enterobacter cloacae (CR-ECL), 19 CR-KPN/CR-ECO, and
      2 CR-KPN/CR-ECL were detected. Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC),
      New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM), and a combination of KPC and NDM
      were detected in 150, 9, and 11 swab samples, respectively. Multivariable
      logistic regression analysis determined length of ICU stay, chronic
      neurological disease, transfer from other hospitals, previous infection,
      and history of antibiotics exposure as independent risk factors for CRE
      positivity. Age and cardiovascular diseases were independent risk factors
      for mixed infections of CRE. The occurrence of CRE in secondary and
      tertiary hospitals was 15.06 and 25.62%, respectively (P < 0.05). Patients
      from tertiary hospitals had different clinical features compared with
      those from secondary hospitals, including longer hospital stays, a higher
      rate of patients transferred from other hospitals, receiving renal
      replacement therapy, exposure to immunosuppressive drugs, use of
      antibiotics, and a higher rate of the previous infection. CONCLUSION: In
      ICUs in Henan Province, CRE positive rate was very high, mostly KPC-type
      CR-KPN. Patients with prolonged ICU stay, chronic neurological disease,
      transfer from other hospitals, previous infection, and history of
      antibiotic exposure are prone to CRE. Age and cardiovascular diseases are
      susceptibility factors for mixed infections of CRE. The CRE positive rate
      in tertiary hospitals was higher than that in secondary hospitals, which
      may be related to the source of patients, antibiotic exposure, disease
      severity, and previous infection.

      Klebsiella pneumoniae and 4 carbapenemase-producing Enterobacter cloacae),
      80 Acinetobacter baumannii, 6 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 20
      Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Ceftolozane/tazobactam, ceftazidime,
      ceftazidime/avibactam, cefepime, aztreonam, meropenem, amikacin,
      ciprofloxacin, colistin and tigecycline were used as comparators against
      Enterobacterales, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. Minocycline,
      levofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were studied against S.
      maltophilia instead of aztreonam, ciprofloxacin and cefepime. MICs were
      determined by broth microdilution according to CLSI guidelines. MIC
      determination was performed in CAMHB for all antimicrobials except
      cefiderocol, where iron-depleted CAMHB was used. RESULTS: Cefiderocol
      showed potent in vitro activity against the isolates analysed. MIC50 and
      MIC90 values were in the ranges 0.125-8 mg/L and 0.5-8 mg/L, respectively,
      and 98% of isolates were inhibited at ≤4 mg/L. Only five isolates showed
      cefiderocol MICs of >4 mg/L: three ST2/OXA-24/40-producing A. baumannii,
      one ST114/VIM-1-producing E. cloacae and one ST114/VIM-1 +
      OXA-48-producing E. cloacae. All KPC-3-producing K. pneumoniae were
      susceptible to cefiderocol, even those resistant to ceftazidime/avibactam.
      P. aeruginosa isolates showed cefiderocol MICs of <4 mg/L, including those
      resistant to ceftolozane/tazobactam. S. maltophilia isolates displayed
      cefiderocol MICs of <4 mg/L, including those resistant to levofloxacin
      and/or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. CONCLUSIONS: Cefiderocol showed
      excellent activity against MDR-GNB, including carbapenem-resistant
      isolates, and was the most active antimicrobial tested against this
      collection.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Imipenem-relebactam is a new β-lactam and β-lactamase
      inhibitor combination to treat carbapenem-resistant gram-negative bacteria
      infections. However, difference in carbapenem resistant mechanisms existed
      with geographic variations. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the susceptibility of
      imipenem-relebactam to 660 carbapenem-nonsusceptible Enterobacteriaceae
      isolates in Taiwan and to identify the in vivo efficacy with a
      Caenorhabditis elegans model. METHODS: 188 carbapenem-nonsusceptible
      Escherichia coli isolates and 472 carbapenem-nonsusceptible Klebsiella
      pneumoniae isolates were collected from a national surveillance study in
      Taiwan. The antimicrobial susceptibility profiles and carbapenemase
      distributions were determined. An agar dilution method was performed to
      evaluate the in vitro activities of imipenem monotherapy and
      imipenem-relebactam combination. Contributions of metallo-carbapenemase to
      imipenem-relebactam susceptibility was investigated via EDTA treatment. A
      C. elegans model was used to evaluate the in vivo efficacy of
      imipenem-relebactam combination. RESULTS: 87.8% and 82.2% susceptibility
      to imipenem-relebactam was observed for 188 carbapenem-nonsusceptible E.
      coli and 472 carbapenem-nonsusceptible K. pneumoniae, respectively.
      However, poor activities of imipenem-relebactam was observed against 23
      metallo-carbapenemase producers tested in this study. In the in vivo C.
      elegans model, imipenem-relebactam significantly rescued nematodes from
      the infection of a bla(KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae isolate. CONCLUSION:
      Our study supports that imipenem-relebactam is a potential therapy against
      carbapenem-nonsusceptible Enterobacteriaceae, and to our knowledge, this
      is the first report of evaluation for imipenem-relebactam efficacy against
      carbapenem-nonsusceptible Enterobacteriaceae in Taiwan.

AB  - The aim of this preliminary study was to identify microorganisms with
      antimicrobial resistance profile and biofilm producers in oropharynx of
      Rupornis magnirostris and Caracara plancus. Six R. magnirostris and six C.
      plancus maintained in Triage Center for Wild Animals (CETAS) facilities
      were studied. Coagulase-positive staphylococci (CoPS), enterobacteria, and
      yeasts were identified by the biochemical analysis or MALDI-TOF mass
      spectrometry. The resistance profile of the microorganisms was analyzed
      according to CLSI. The biofilm production was evaluated by Congo red and
      violet crystal staining methods. Among the 12 birds, 10 presented strains
      of CoPS and/or enterobacteria with resistance profile, such as
      methicillin-resistant CoPS (MR-CoPS), vancomycin-resistant CoPS (VR-CoPS),
      extended-spectrum β-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (ESBL), and
      Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase- (KPC-) producing bacteria. Regards
      the fungal analysis, Candida spp., Cryptococcus spp., Rhodotorula
      mucilaginosa, R. glutinis, and Trichosporon coremiiforme were identified.
      All the Trichosporon coremiiforme strains were resistant to amphotericin
      B, as well as all the Rhodotorula mucilaginosa exhibited resistance to
      fluconazole. Related to the biofilm production, among the 8 CoPS, 27
      enterobacteria, and 10 yeasts isolates, 3, 16, and 7 strains were biofilm
      producers, respectively. Thus, the presence of these microorganisms in
      birds of prey is worrisome, highlighting its possible influence in the
      spread of infections in urban centers.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The increase in skin and soft tissue infections (SSTI)
      because of multidrug-resistant (MDR) pathogens is a global concern.
      Although MDR Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) are often overlooked as a cause
      of SSTIs, their burden on the morbidity of many subgroups of patients is
      high. There is a paucity in the available treatment options and guidelines
      on how to treat these pathogens. This manuscript reviews the management of
      SSTIs caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa (CRPA), Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB), and Stenotrophomonas
      maltophilia. We also highlight a few novel antibiotics that show promise
      in the future management of MDR-GNB SSTIs. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies on
      treatment options of MDR-GNB SSTIs are scarce. Most clinical trials
      investigating new antibiotics have addressed conditions such as
      complicated intraabdominal infections, complicated urinary infections, and
      respiratory infections. CREs are a heterogenous group of pathogens with
      various mechanisms of resistance dictating susceptibility to different
      antimicrobial agents. Ceftazidime--avibactam, and meropenem--vaborbactam
      have potent activity against some of the CREs, especially Klebsiella
      pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) producers. Several novel antibiotics have
      potent activity against CRPA SSTIs, such as ceftazidime--avibactam,
      ceftolozane--tazobactam, cefiderocol, delafloxacin, finafloxacin, and
      murepavadin. Cefiderocol may also play an important role in the management
      of CRAB SSTIs, along with plazomicin and eravacycline. SUMMARY: MDR-GNB
      play a major role in SSTIs in patients with underlying immunodeficiency,
      as well as burn or trauma-related injuries. With the alarming global rise
      in MDR-GNB resistance, antibiotic therapy for SSTIs is challenging and
      must be guided by in-vitro susceptibility results. Currently, data
      extrapolated from other indications and combination therapy can be used
      empirically pending microbiological data and susceptibilities. Novel
      antibiotics are currently under development. It is hoped that future
      clinical trials will be designed to address MDR-GNB SSTIs.

AB  - Gram-negative bacilli septic thrombosis (GNB-ST) represents a subtle and
      often misleading condition, potentially fatal if not recognized early and
      requiring prolonged antimicrobial therapy and anticoagulation. Herein,
      reported for the first time, is a very challenging case of Klebsiella
      producing carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K. pneumoniae (KPC-Kp) ST
      unresponsive to ceftazidime/avibactam (CZA) relapsed first with
      meropenem/vaborbactam (MVB) monotherapy and subsequently cured with MVB
      plus fosfomycin (FOS) combination. The present case highlights the
      possibility of CZA underexposure on the infected thrombus and the risk of
      in vivo emergence of CZA resistance in the setting of persistent
      bacteremia and sub-optimal anticoagulation. Pharmacokinetic analyses
      showed that both MVB and FOS were in the therapeutic range. In vitro
      studies demonstrated a high level of MVB + FOS synergism that possibly
      allowed definitive resolution of the endovascular infection.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The 16S rRNA methylase-mediated high-level resistance to
      aminoglycosides has become a great concern. The purpose of the study was
      to investigate the occurrence of 16S rRNA methyltransferase (RMTase) genes
      in carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) clinical isolates
      associated with bloodstream infections (BSIs) in China. METHODS: From July
      2015 to December 2018, a total of 137 unique CRKP clinical isolates
      associated with BSIs were collected from 11 Chinese teaching hospitals.
      PCR and DNA sequencing were used to identify 16S RMTase genes.
      Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed on all CRKP clinical isolates.
      Relevant information was extracted from WGS data (antibiotic resistance
      determinants, K-type and wzi allelic types). All 16S RMTase-producing CRKP
      clinical isolates were characterized by antimicrobial susceptibility
      testing, multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field gel
      electrophoresis (PFGE). RESULTS: In this study, 137 CRKPs were found to
      harbor at least one carbapenemase gene. Among 137 CRKPs, 78 (56.9%,
      78/137) were positive for 16S RMTase genes (5 for armA, 70 for rmtB, 3 for
      both armA and rmtB) and highly resistant to gentamicin and amikacin (MICs
      ≥256 mg/L). Seventy-five isolates harboring 16S RMTase genes also produced
      ESBLs. In this study, 5 sequence types (STs) and 6 capsule serotypes were
      found among 78 isolates positive for 16S RMTases genes, while 14 STs and 6
      capsule serotypes were found among 59 isolates negative for 16S RMTases
      genes. Compared with the isolates negative for 16S RMTases genes, the STs
      and capsular serotypes of 16S RMTases-positive strains are more
      concentrated. Among 78 16S RMTases-positive strains, the most prevalent
      clone type is ST11-PFGE-B-KL64-wzi64 (62.8%, 49/78), which mainly carries
      the rmtB and bla(KPC) genes and is distributed in 7 provinces in China.
      CONCLUSION: A high prevalence of 16S RMTase genes was found among CRKP
      clinical isolates associated with BSIs from Chinese teaching hospitals,
      which was attributed to the dissemination of the ST11-PFGE-B-KL64-wzi64
      clone.

AB  - The development of antibiotic resistance is a major public health issue,
      as infections are increasingly unresponsive to antibiotics. Emerging
      antimicrobial resistance has raised researchers' interest in the
      development of alternative strategies using natural compounds with
      antibacterial activity, like honey, which has emerged as an agent to treat
      several infections and wound injuries. Nevertheless, the antibacterial
      effect of honey was mostly evaluated against Gram-positive bacteria.
      Hence, the objective of our study was to evaluate the antibacterial
      activity, as well as the physicochemical parameters, of genuine Greek
      honeys against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria. In
      this vein, we aimed to study the in vitro antibacterial potential of rare
      Greek honeys against Verona integron-encoded metallo-β-lactamase (VIM)- or
      Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing multidrug-resistant
      Gram-negative pathogens. Physicochemical parameters such as pH, hydrogen
      peroxide, free acidity, lactonic acid, total phenols total flavonoids,
      free radical scavenging activities, tyrosinase enzyme inhibitory activity
      and kojic acid were examined. Moreover, the antimicrobial activity of 10
      different honey types was evaluated in five consecutive dilutions (75%,
      50%, 25%, 12.5% and 6.25%) against the clinical isolates by the well
      diffusion method, as well as by the determination of the minimum
      inhibition concentration after the addition of catalase and protease.
      Almost all the physicochemical parameters varied significantly among the
      different honeys. Fir and manuka honey showed the highest values in pH and
      H(2)O(2), while the free acidity and lactonic acid levels were higher in
      chestnut honey. Total phenols, total flavonoids and free radical
      scavenging activities were found higher in cotton, arbutus and manuka
      honey, and finally, manuka and oregano honeys showed higher tyrosinase
      inhibition activity and kojic acid levels. The antimicrobial
      susceptibility depended on the type of honey, on its dilution, on the
      treatment methodology and on the microorganism. Arbutus honey was the most
      potent against VIM-producing Enterobacter cloacae subsp. dissolvens in 75%
      concentration, while fir honey was more lethal for the same microorganism
      in the 25% concentration. Many honeys outperformed manuka honey in their
      antibacterial potency. It is of interest that, for any given concentration
      in the well diffusion method and for any given type of honey, significant
      differences were not detected among the four multidrug-resistant
      pathogens, which explains that the damaging effect to the bacterial cells
      was the same regardless of the bacterial species or strain. Although the
      antimicrobial potency of different honey varieties dependents on their
      geographical origin and on their compositional differences, the exact
      underlying mechanism remains yet unclear.

AB  - Emerging carbapenem resistance in Escherichia coli, including sequence
      type 131 (ST131), the leading cause of extraintestinal E. coli infections
      globally, threatens therapeutic efficacy. Accordingly, we determined broth
      microdilution MICs for three distinctive newer agents, i.e., cefiderocol
      (CFDC), ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA), and eravacycline (ERV), plus 11
      comparators, against 343 carbapenem-resistant (CR) clinical E. coli
      isolates, then compared susceptibility results with bacterial
      characteristics and region. The collection comprised 203 U.S. isolates
      (2002 to 2017) and 141 isolates from 17 countries in Europe, Latin
      America, and the Asia-West Pacific region (2003 to 2017). Isolates were
      characterized for phylogenetic group, resistance-associated sequence types
      (STs) and subsets thereof, and relevant beta-lactamase-encoding genes.
      CFDC, CZA, and ERV exhibited the highest percent susceptible (82% to 98%)
      after tigecycline (TGC) (99%); avibactam improved CZA's activity over that
      of CAZ (11% susceptible). Percent susceptible varied by phylogroup and ST
      for CFDC and CZA (greatest in phylogroups B2, D, and F, and in ST131,
      ST405, and ST648). Susceptibility also varied by resistance genotype,
      being higher with the Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) for CZA,
      lower with metallo-beta-lactamases for CFDC and CZA, and higher with the
      beta-lactamase CTX-M for ERV. Percent susceptible also varied by global
      region for CZA (lower in Asia-Pacific) and by U.S. region for ERV (lower
      in the South and Southeast). Although resistance to comparators often
      predicted reduced susceptibility to a primary agent (especially CFDC and
      CZA), even among comparator-resistant isolates the
      primary-agent-susceptible fraction usually exceeded 50%. These findings
      clarify the likely utility of CFDC, CZA, and ERV against CR E. coli in
      relation to multiple bacterial characteristics and geographical region.

AB  - The Australian Group on Antimicrobial Resistance (AGAR) performs regular
      period-prevalence studies to monitor changes in antimicrobial resistance
      in selected enteric gram-negative pathogens. The 2018 survey was the sixth
      year to focus on bloodstream infections, and included Enterobacterales,
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species. Eight thousand three
      hundred and fifty isolates, comprising Enterobacterales (7,512, 90.0%), P.
      aeruginosa (743, 8.9%) and Acinetobacter species (95, 1.1%), were tested
      using commercial automated methods. The results were analysed using
      Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and European Committee
      on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoints (January
      2019). Of the key resistances, resistance to the third-generation
      cephalosporin, ceftriaxone, was found in 13.4%/13.4% of Escherichia coli
      (CLSI/EUCAST criteria), and 9.4%/9.4% of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Resistance
      rates to ciprofloxacin were 15.2%/15.2% for E. coli, 11.3%/11.3% for K.
      pneumoniae, 7.4%/7.4% for Enterobacter cloacae complex, and 3.6%/7.7% for
      P. aeruginosa. Resistance rates to piperacillin-tazobactam were 3.0%/6.0%,
      4.3%/7.9%, 18.2%/22.0%, and 5.1%/11.1% for the same four species
      respectively. Thirty-one isolates from 27 patients were shown to harbour a
      carbapenemase gene: 14 bla(IMP-4) (11 patients), including one with
      bla(IMP-4)+bla(OXA-23), four bla(KPC) (three patients), three bla(OXA-48),
      three bla(NDM), three bla(GES), two bla(OXA-181), and two bla(OXA-23).

AB  - Diabetes is a leading non-communicable disease and a risk factor for
      relapsing infections. The current study was aimed at investigating the
      prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of carbapenem-resistant (CR)
      uropathogens of the family Enterobacteriaceae in diabetic patients. The
      data of 910 bacterial isolates was collected from diagnostic laboratories
      during January 2018 to December 2018. The bacterial isolates were
      identified using traditional methods including colonial characteristics,
      biochemical tests, and API (20E). Antimicrobial susceptibility and
      phenotypic characterization of ESBL, MBLs, and KPC was determined by
      utilizing CLSI recommended methods. The phenotypically positive isolates
      were further analyzed for resistance-encoding genes by manual PCR and
      Check-MDR CT103XL microarray. Susceptibility to colistin and cefiderocol
      was tested in accordance with CLSI guidelines. The data revealed that most
      of the patients were suffering from type 2 diabetes for a duration of more
      than a year and with uncontrolled blood sugar levels. Escherichia coli and
      Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most frequently encountered pathogens,
      followed by Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis. More than 50% of
      the isolates showed resistance to 22 antibiotics, with the highest
      resistance (>80%) against tetracycline, ampicillin, and cefazolin. The
      uropathogens showed less resistance to non-β-lactam antibiotics, including
      amikacin, fosfomycin, and nitrofurantoin. In the phenotypic assays, 495
      (54.3%) isolates were found to be ESBL producers, while ESBL-TEM and -PER
      were the most prevalent ESBL types. The resistance to carbapenems was
      slightly less (250; 27.5%) than ESBL producers, yet more common amongst E.
      coli isolates. MBL production was a common feature in carbapenem-resistant
      isolates (71.2%); genotypic characterization also validated this trend.
      The isolates were found to be sensitive against the new drugs, cefiderocol
      and eravacycline. with 7-28% resistance, except for P. mirabilis which had
      100% resistance against eravacycline. This study concludes that a few
      types of ESBL and carbapenemases are common in the uropathogens isolated
      from the diabetic patients, and antibiotic stewardship programs need to be
      revisited, particularly to cure UTIs in diabetic patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed to evaluate the antibacterial activity of
      the latex of three species members of Jatropha (J. curcas, J. gossypilofia
      Linn., and J. multifida) against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
      aureus (MRSA), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase- (ESBL-) producing
      Escherichia coli and ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumonia,
      carbapenemase-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE)-E. coli, K.
      pneumoniae-carbapenemase (KPC), and carbapenemase-resistant Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa (CRPA). METHOD: The antibacterial activities were calculated
      based on the inhibition zones using the Mueller-Hinton agar diffusion
      method, minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) using Mueller-Hinton broth
      in a microdilution method, and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC)
      using blood agar plate. RESULTS: The latex of Jatropha showed
      antibacterial activities against the MRSA and CRPA. All latex of Jatropha
      appeared to have the antibacterial activities against MRSA and CRPA in the
      diffusion method (20.4-23.7 mm and 12-15 mm), MIC (0.19-6.25%, and 25%),
      and MBC (0.39-12.5% and 50%). Phytochemical screening of latex indicated
      the presence of flavonoids. CONCLUSIONS: The latex of J. curcas, J.
      gossypilofia Linn., and J. multifida has the potential to be developed as
      antibacterial agents, especially against MRSA and CRPA strain, but further
      in vivo research and discovery of the mode of its action are required to
      shed the light on the effects.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Emerging carbapenem resistance in Escherichia coli, including
      sequence type 131 (ST131), threatens therapeutic efficacy. Plazomicin
      (PLZ), a semisynthetic aminoglycoside approved by the FDA in 2018,
      overcomes the most common aminoglycoside resistance mechanisms and
      maintains activity against many carbapenem-intermediate or -resistant
      (CIR) E. coli strains. OBJECTIVES: To assess plazomicin susceptibility
      among CIR E. coli in relation to region and multiple bacterial
      characteristics. METHODS: We determined broth microdilution MICs for
      plazomicin and 11 comparators against 343 CIR clinical E. coli isolates,
      then compared susceptibility results by bacterial characteristics and
      region. The collection comprised 203 US isolates (2002-17) and 141
      isolates from 17 countries in Europe, Latin America, and the Asia-West
      Pacific region (2003-17). Isolates were characterized for phylogenetic
      group, resistance-associated sequence types (STs) and subsets thereof, and
      relevant β-lactamase-encoding genes. RESULTS: Plazomicin exhibited the
      highest percentage susceptible (89%) after tigecycline (99%). The
      percentage susceptible to plazomicin varied significantly by phylogroup
      (63%, group B1; versus >93%, others) and ST131 subclone (92%, H30Rx;
      versus 87%-89%, H30R1 and non-H30), but not ST. It also varied by
      resistance genotype [higher with Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase
      (KPC), lower with metallo-β-lactamases], global region [highest for Latin
      America (94%), lowest for Asia-West Pacific (69%)], and US region (80%,
      South, versus 96%-100%, others). Although reduced susceptibility to
      comparators often predicted reduced susceptibility to plazomicin, even
      among comparator-intermediate or -resistant isolates the
      plazomicin-susceptible fraction was ≥77%, except for amikacin (53%).
      CONCLUSIONS: The likely utility of plazomicin against CIR E. coli is high
      overall, but varies with region and multiple bacterial characteristics.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Antimicrobial resistance, including multidrug-resistance
      (MDR), is increasing, especially among Gram-negative bacilli. New agents
      are needed to treat infections caused by these pathogens. This report
      assessed the activity of imipenem/relebactam against Gram-negative bacilli
      from intraabdominal infections (IAIs) and urinary tract infections (UTIs)
      submitted to the SMART (Study for Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance
      Trends) global surveillance programme in the United States from 2015 to
      2017. METHODS: Broth microdilution MICs for imipenem/relebactam and
      comparators were determined by a central laboratory against isolates of
      non-Proteeae Enterobacteriaceae (NPE) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P.
      aeruginosa). Imipenem/relebactam MICs were interpreted using United States
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) breakpoints. RESULTS: 99.5% of NPE
      isolates collected from patients with IAIs (n=3633) and UTIs (n=3038) were
      susceptible to imipenem/relebactam, as were 77.9% of
      imipenem-nonsusceptible, 96.3% of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase
      (KPC)-positive, and 98.7% of MDR isolates from IAIs and UTIs combined. A
      total of 96.7% of IAI isolates (n=486) and 96.4% of UTI isolates (n=360)
      of P. aeruginosa were susceptible to imipenem/relebactam, as were 85.0% of
      imipenem-nonsusceptible and 87.3% of MDR isolates from IAIs and UTIs
      combined. Percent susceptibility to imipenem/relebactam for cefepime-,
      ceftazidime-, and piperacillin-tazobactam-nonsusceptible isolates was
      98.3-98.8% for NPE and 87.3-90.0% for P. aeruginosa. CONCLUSIONS:
      Imipenem/relebactam demonstrated potent in vitro activity against NPE and
      P. aeruginosa isolates from IAIs and UTIs, including against resistant
      subsets, and will provide important coverage for IAIs and UTIs caused by
      β-lactam-resistant, MDR, and KPC-positive Gram-negative bacilli.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the molecular characteristics of
      carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) from county hospitals in
      China. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-three sequential non-duplicate CRE
      strains (including 33 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 4 Enterobacter
      cloacae isolates, 3 Escherichia coli isolates, 1 Serratia marcescens, 1
      Morganella morganii and 1 Citrobacter freundii) were collected from 4
      county hospitals and 2 municipal hospitals. Antimicrobial susceptibility
      testing was conducted by broth microdilution method, using
      3-aminophenylboronic acid and EDTA and the modified carbapenem
      inactivation method (mCIM) to screen phenotype of carbapenemase.
      β-Lactamases were characterized by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA
      sequencing. The transferability of bla (NDM-5) was investigated by
      transformation experiment. Clonal relatedness was evaluated by
      pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing . RESULTS:
      The results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing indicated that 43 CRE
      strains were resistant to most of the antimicrobial agents, except
      tigecycline and colistin. Overall, 93%, 93%, and 97.7% of these strains
      were resistant to imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem, respectively. PCR
      and DNA sequencing indicated that 67.4% (29/43) were bla (KPC-2) positive
      isolates, in which 3.4% (1/29) was coproduced with bla (NDM-1). In
      addition, 7.0% (3/43), 4.7% (2/43), 4.7% (2/43), 2.3% (1/43), 2.3% (1/43)
      were bla (NDM-1), bla (NDM-16), bla (NDM-4), bla (NDM-5), bla (IMP-4)
      positive isolates, respectively. The 29 bla (KPC-2)-positive isolates
      belonged to 12 different PFGE type and designated as ST11 (n=20) and ST15,
      ST39, ST116, ST667, ST2245, ST2338. The plasmid bearing bla (NDM-5) could
      be transferred into recipient E. coli J53 through transformation.
      CONCLUSION: Our study indicated the dissemination of CRE between the
      tertiary hospitals and secondary hospitals.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Community-acquired infections by multidrug-resistant (MDR),
      extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL) producing Klebsiella species
      (Klebsiella spp.) is of major concern worldwide. Antibiotic resistance,
      production of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), and carbapenemases,
      as well as the presence of classes 1, 2, and 3 integrons in outpatient
      isolates of Klebsiella collected from Yazd central laboratory, Yazd, Iran.
      METHODS: We collected 250 Klebsiella isolates from Yazd central laboratory
      between August 2015 and October 2017. Antibiotic susceptibility was
      determined against 18 antibiotics by disc diffusion, and
      multidrug-resistant isolates were tested for ESBL production by the
      phenotypic confirmatory test according to CLSI 2017 protocols. The
      amplification of β-lactamase genes bla(SHV) , bla(TEM) , bla(CTX-M) ,
      bla(OXA-48) , bla(KPC) , and bla(NDM) , classes 1, 2, and 3 integrase
      genes, was carried out using specific primers and polymerase chain
      reaction (PCR). RESULTS: Of the 250 Klebsiella outpatient isolates, 3.6%
      were K. oxytoca and the rest were K. pneumoniae. Disc diffusion showed
      that 21 (8.4%) isolates were MDR, 19 (90.4%) of which were ESBL producers
      including one K. oxytoca. The most prevalent β-lactamase gene was bla(SHV)
      followed by bla(TEM) and bla(CTX-M) , but bla(OXA-48) , bla(KPC) , and
      bla(NDM) were not detected. Class 1 integron was detected in 18 out of 21
      MDR isolates (85.7%), but classes 2 and 3 were not observed. Two isolates
      were resistant to carbapenems and harbored bla(SHV) , bla(TEM) , and
      bla(CTX-M) , as well as class 1 integron. CONCLUSION: ESBL production and
      the presence of multiple β-lactamase genes in MDR community isolates of
      Klebsiella spp. can have significant implications in terms of the spread
      of these opportunistic pathogens.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The microbial community composition of urban environments is
      primarily determined by human activity. The use of metagenomics to explore
      how microbial communities are shaped in a city provides a novel input that
      can improve decisions on public health measures, architectural design, and
      urban resilience. Of note, the sewage system in a city acts as a complex
      reservoir of bacteria, pharmaceuticals, and antimicrobial resistant (AMR)
      genes that can be an important source of epidemiological information.
      Hospital effluents are rich in patient-derived bacteria and can thus
      readily become a birthplace and hotspot reservoir for antibiotic resistant
      pathogens which are eventually incorporated into the environment. Yet, the
      scope to which nosocomial outbreaks impact the urban environment is still
      poorly understood. RESULTS: In this work, we extensively show that
      different urban waters from creeks, beaches, sewage spillways and
      collector pipes enclose discrete microbial communities that are
      characterized by a differential degree of contamination and admixture with
      human-derived bacteria. The abundance of human bacteria correlates with
      the abundance of AMR genes in the environment, with beta-lactamases being
      the top-contributing class to distinguish low vs. highly-impacted urban
      environments. Indeed, the abundance of beta-lactamase resistance and
      carbapenem resistance determinants in the urban environment significantly
      increased in a 1-year period. This was in line with a pronounced increase
      of nosocomial carbapenem-resistant infections reported during the same
      period that was mainly driven by an outbreak-causing,
      carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (KPC) ST-11 strain.
      Genome-resolved metagenomics of urban waters before and after this
      outbreak, coupled with high-resolution whole-genome sequencing, confirmed
      the dissemination of the ST-11 strain and a novel KPC megaplasmid from the
      hospital to the urban environment. City-wide analysis showed that
      geospatial dissemination of the KPC megaplasmid in the urban environment
      inversely depended on the sewage system infrastructure. CONCLUSIONS: We
      show how urban metagenomics and outbreak genomic surveillance can be
      coupled to generate relevant information for infection control, antibiotic
      stewardship, and pathogen epidemiology. Our results highlight the need to
      better characterize and understand how human-derived bacteria and
      antimicrobial resistance disseminate in the urban environment to
      incorporate this information in the development of effluent treatment
      infrastructure and public health policies. Video Abstract.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Decreased susceptibility to ceftazidime/avibactam (CZA) and
      ceftaroline (CPT) has been reported during antimicrobial resistance
      surveillance and therapy. Conventional laboratories are unable to provide
      timely susceptibility testing for CZA and CPT because these antimicrobial
      agents are not incorporated in automated susceptibility testing systems.
      METHODS: We evaluated Etest and the Sensititre broth microdilution (BMD)
      method for testing CZA against carbapenem-resistant Gram-negative bacilli
      and CPT against important Gram-positive cocci bloodstream isolates.
      Genotypes of carbapenemases in Enterobacterales were also determined using
      the Xpert® Carba-R assay. RESULTS: Etest showed ≥90% agreement with
      Sensititre BMD for carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) (n =
      187), carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli (CREC) (n = 28) and
      Streptococcus pneumoniae (n = 35); however, the very major error rate
      exceeded 3%. Agreement between Etest and Sensititre BMD was <90% for
      carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CRPA) (n = 81),
      methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) (n = 92) and
      methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) (n = 170). Both agents remained
      potent with a high susceptibility rate by Sensititre BMD as follows: CZA
      against CRKP (95.0%), CREC (89.3%) and CRPA (84.5%); and CPT against MSSA
      (100.0%), MRSA (95.3%) and S. pneumoniae (94.3%). CZA was active against
      bla(KPC)-carrying CRKP (98.5% susceptible), and resistance in the majority
      of CZA-resistant Enterobacterales isolates (6 of 10 CRKP and 2 of 3 CREC)
      was due to the presence of a metallo-β-lactamase gene. CONCLUSION: Our
      results suggest that interpretation of susceptibility results obtained by
      Etest for both agents should be undertaken cautiously and remains
      challenging.

AB  - BACKGROUND: There is an increasing use of daily chlorhexidine gluconate
      (CHG) bathing to decrease healthcare associated infections (HAI). Daily
      bathing of patients with CHG has been successfully used to prevent
      multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) HAI in intensive care units (ICU).
      METHODS: This was a 12-month, single-center, open, cluster randomized
      trial, conducted at four ICUs of the University Hospital of Universidade
      Federal de São Paulo, Unifesp, Brazil. ICUs were randomized to either
      perform daily bathing of the patients with pH neutral soap and water -
      control units, or daily bathing with 2% CHG detergent solution -
      intervention units. We evaluated the incidence density rate of central
      line-associated bloodstream infection (CLABSI), ventilator-associated
      pneumonia (VAP), catheter associated urinary tract infection (CAUTI),
      Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing enterobacteria HAI,
      and death in the intervention and control units. RESULTS: A total of 1,640
      admissions of 1,487 patients occurred during the study period (41.2%
      control group, and 58.8% intervention group). Incidence density rates of
      KPC-producing enterobacteria HAI were 5.01 and 2.25 infections/1000
      patient-days in the control units and in the intervention units (p =
      0.013) and mortality rates were 28.7% and 18.7% in the control units and
      in the intervention units (p<0.001), respectively. No difference between
      groups was observed in CLABSI incidence (p = 0.125), VAP incidence (p =
      0.247) and CAUTI incidence (p = 0.435). No serious skin reactions were
      noted in either study group. Daily 2% CHG detergent solution bathing is a
      feasible, low cost option for HAI prevention in ICU.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: A systematic literature review was undertaken to evaluate
      real-world use of ceftazidime-avibactam for infections due to aerobic
      Gram-negative organisms in adults with limited treatment options. METHODS:
      Literature searches retrieved peer-reviewed publications and abstracts
      from major international infectious disease congresses from January 2015
      to February 2021. Results were screened using pre-defined criteria to
      limit the dataset to relevant publications (notable exclusions were
      paediatric data and outcomes data for bacteria intrinsically resistant to
      ceftazidime-avibactam). Data for included publications were subjected to
      qualitative synthesis. RESULTS: Seventy-three relevant publications (62
      peer-reviewed articles; 10 abstracts) comprising 1926 patients treated
      with ceftazidime-avibactam (either alone or combined with other
      antimicrobials) and 1114 comparator/control patients were identified. All
      patients were hospitalised for serious illness and most had multiple
      comorbidities. The most common infections were pneumonia, bacteraemia, and
      skin/soft tissue, urinary tract, or abdominal infections; smaller numbers
      of patients with meningitis, febrile neutropenia, osteomyelitis, and
      cystic fibrosis were also included. Carbapenem-resistant or
      carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CRE; n = 1718) and
      carbapenem-resistant, multidrug-resistant (MDR), and extensively
      drug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 150) were the most common
      pathogens. Most publications reported positive outcomes for
      ceftazidime-avibactam treatment (clinical success rates ranged from 45 to
      100% and reported 30-day mortality from 0 to 63%), which were
      statistically superior versus comparators in some studies.
      ceftazidime-avibactam resistance emergence occurred infrequently and
      mostly in Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing K.
      pneumoniae strains. CONCLUSION: This review provides qualitative evidence
      of successful use of ceftazidime-avibactam for the treatment of
      hospitalised patients with CRE and MDR P. aeruginosa infections with
      limited treatment options.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Surveillance of health care-associated infections (HAIs) is
      an essential part of an efficient healthcare system. This study is an
      update on incidence and mortality rates of HAIs in Iran in 2018. METHODS:
      Almost all hospitals across the country (940 hospitals) entered the data
      of HAIs and denominators to the Iranian Nosocomial Infections Surveillance
      (INIS) software. Statistics were derived from INIS. RESULTS: From
      9,607,213 hospitalized patients, 127,953 suffered from HAI, 15.65% of whom
      died. The incidence rate of HAI was calculated as 4.2 per 1000
      patient-days. Considering relative frequencies among HAIs, Pneumonia
      (29.1%) and UTIs (25.6%) were the most common types of infection.
      Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) was the most frequent
      device-associated infection (DAI) 25.66 per 1000 ventilator-days, and had
      the highest mortality rate (43.08%). Incidence density of other DAIs was
      5.43 for catheter-associated UTI and 2.86 for catheter-associated BSI per
      1000 device-days. Medical ICUs had the highest incidence and percentage of
      deaths (15.35% and 37.63%, respectively). The most causative organisms
      were Escherichia coli, Acinetobacter baumannii, and Klebsiella pneumonia.
      The rate of methicillin-resistance Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA),
      vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), and Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenemase (KPC)-producing bacteria was about 49%, 57%, and 58%
      respectively. CONCLUSION: This study provided an overview of HAIs in Iran
      and indicated that HAIs required special attention both in
      detection/reporting and in infection control measures. Future studies
      could be done on adherence rate of DAIs' preventive bundles, interventions
      via multimodal strategies, evaluating the effect of training, and effect
      of antibiotic stewardship programs.

AB  - AIM: To evaluate the changes in antimicrobial consumption and
      multidrug-resistant microorganism trends after introducing an empiric
      antimicrobial therapy manual to support antimicrobial stewardship.
      METHODS: A 4-year prospective interventional study assessed the effect of
      introducing an empiric antimicrobial therapy manual in medical and
      surgical wards during two periods: pre-intervention period (January
      2015-May 2017) and post-intervention period (June 2017-December 2019).
      Outcomes included microorganism trends of bloodstream infections (BSI) for
      Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing bacteria (KPC), extended
      spectrum beta-lactamase ESBL-E. coli, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus
      aureus (MRSA) and Candida albicans. Also, Clostridioides difficile
      infection (CDI) episodes were included. Rates were normalised per 1000
      patient-days (PD). Antimicrobial consumption was assessed as defined daily
      dose (DDD)/1000 PD in interrupted time series analysis. RESULTS: In
      medical wards, we observed a significant decrease in the consumption of
      piperacillin-tazobactam and a decrease in the trends of tigecycline and
      vancomycin consumption. In surgical wards, there was a significant
      decrease in consumption of fluoroquinolones and piperacillin-tazobactam.
      This decrease was maintained in trend for all the antimicrobials but was
      significant for tigecycline only. In medical wards, there was a
      significant reduction of MRSA and C. albicans. In surgical wards, we
      observed a decrease in MRSA, ESBL-E. coli, C. albicans and CDI. KPC cases
      decreased by 22.5% in medical wards and 74.3% in surgical wards.
      CONCLUSION: The results suggest that a persuasive educational approach to
      antimicrobial stewardship, with the introduction of an empiric
      antimicrobial manual and continuous education, resulted in reductions in
      both antimicrobial use and healthcare-associated BSI caused by
      multidrug-resistant organisms. More studies with longer follow up are
      needed to investigate the effect of antimicrobial stewardship on clinical
      outcomes.

AB  - Owing to the over usage of carbapenems, carbapenem resistance has become a
      vital threat worldwide, and, thus, the World Health Organization announced
      the carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) as the critical priority
      for antibiotic development in 2017. In the current situation, combination
      therapy would be one solution against CRE. Azidothymidine (AZT), a
      thymidine analog, has demonstrated its synergistically antibacterial
      activities with other antibiotics. The unexpected antimicrobial activity
      of the immunomodulator ammonium trichloro(dioxoethylene-o,o')tellurate
      (AS101) has been reported against carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella
      pneumoniae (CRKP). Here, we sought to investigate the synergistic activity
      between AS101 and AZT against 12 CRKP clinical isolates. According to the
      gene detection results, the bla(OXA-1) (7/12, 58.3%)(,) bla(DHA) (7/12,
      58.3%), and bla(KPC) (7/12, 58.3%) genes were the most prevalent ESBL,
      AmpC, and carbapenemase genes, respectively. The checkerboard analysis
      demonstrated the remarkable synergism between AS101 and AZT, with the
      observable decrease in the MIC value for two agents and the fractional
      inhibitory concentration (FIC) index ≤0.5 in all strains. Hence, the
      combination of AS101 and azidothymidine could be a potential treatment
      option against CRKP for drug development.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Prompt implementation of appropriate targeted antibiotic
      therapy representsa valuable approach in improving clinical and ecological
      outcome in critically septic patients. Thismultidisciplinary opinion
      article aims to develop evidence-based algorithms for targeted
      antibiotictherapy of infection-related ventilator associated complications
      (IVACs) caused by Enterobacterales,which are among the most common
      pathogens associated with these conditions. AREAS COVERED: A
      multidisciplinary team of four experts had several rounds of assessment
      for developingalgorithms devoted to targeted antimicrobial therapy of
      IVACs caused by Enterobacterales.A literature search was performed on
      PubMed-MEDLINE (until March 2021) to provide evidence forsupporting
      therapeutic choices. Quality and strength of evidence was established
      according toa hierarchical scale of the study design. Six different
      algorithms with associated recommendations concerning therapeutic choice
      and dosing optimization were suggested according to the
      susceptibilitypattern of Enterobacterales: multi-susceptible,
      extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing,AmpC
      beta-lactamase-producing, Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase
      (KPC)-producing, OXA-48-producing, and metallo-beta-lactamase
      (MBL)-producing Enterobacterales. EXPERT OPINION: The implementation of
      algorithms focused on prompt revision of antibiotic regimensguided by
      results of conventional and rapid diagnostic methodologies, appropriate

AB  - PURPOSE: The Chinese Meropenem Surveillance Study (CMSS) was conducted
      every 2 years from 2010 to 2018 to monitor the antimicrobial activity of
      commonly used antimicrobial agents against nosocomial gram-negative
      bacilli in China. METHODS: From 2010 to 2018, 6,537 gram-negative bacilli
      were collected from 14 teaching hospitals. The minimum inhibitory
      concentrations (MICs) of meropenem and other antimicrobial agents were
      determined using the agar dilution and broth microdilution methods.
      RESULTS: Continuous surveillance indicated that, except for Klebsiella
      pneumoniae, the susceptibility of Enterobacterales to carbapenems was
      relatively stable over time. Carbapenems had the highest activity against
      the tested isolates, with MIC(90) values (MIC for 90% of organisms)
      ranging from 0.032 mg/L to 8 mg/L. More than 90% of bacteria were
      susceptible to either meropenem or imipenem; more than 80% were
      susceptible to ertapenem. The prevalence of extended-spectrum
      beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis
      each year was 50.4-64.3%, 18-41.2%, and 1.9-33.8%, respectively. The
      prevalence of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP) and
      carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii (CRAB) continued to increase
      significantly over time, from 7.6% to 21.2% and 64.6% to 69.3%,
      respectively. The prevalence of CRKP was higher from urinary tract
      infections (25.4%) than from bloodstream infections (14.2%),
      intra-abdominal infections (14.5%), and respiratory infections (14.4%). In
      total, 129 CRKP isolates were evaluated by PCR; of these, 92 (71.3%)
      carried the bla (KPC-2) gene. Colistin maintained very high in vitro
      antimicrobial activity against P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii (more than
      95% of isolates exhibited susceptibility at all timepoints). CONCLUSION:
      The results indicate an increase in K. pneumoniae resistance to
      carbapenems over time, mainly owing to KPC-type carbapenemase production.
      A. baumannii was severely resistant to carbapenems in China. Ongoing
      MIC-based resistance surveillance, like CMSS, provides additional data for
      clinical anti-infective treatment.

AB  - The prevalence of Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) has
      increased dramatically in recent years and has become a global public
      health issue. Since carbapenems are considered the last drugs of choice,
      infections caused by these pathogens are difficult to treat and carry a
      high risk of mortality. Several antibiotic combination regimens have been
      utilized for the management of CRE infections or to eradicate colonization
      in CRE carriers with variable clinical responses. In addition, recent
      studies have explored the use of fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) to
      eradicate CRE infections. Here, we conducted a systematic review of
      publications in which FMT was used to eliminate CRE colonization in
      infected individuals. We searched the PubMed, Cochrane, and Medline
      databases up to November 30, 2021. Ten studies (209 patients) met the
      inclusion criteria for this review with three articles describing
      retrospective cohorts (n = 53 patients) and seven reporting prospective
      data (n = 156 patients), including one randomized open-label clinical
      trial. All studies were published between 2017 and 2021 with eight studies
      from Europe and two from South Korea. There were substantial variations in
      terms of outcome measurements and study endpoint among these studies.
      Among the 112 FMT recipients with confirmed CRE colonization, CRE
      decolonization was reported in 55/90 cases at one month after FMT and at
      the end of the study follow-up (6-12 months), decolonization was
      documented in 74/94 (78.7%) patients. The predominant CRE strains reported
      were Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli and the most frequently
      documented carbapenemases were KPC, OXA-48, and NDM. In general, FMT was
      well tolerated, with no severe complications reported even in
      immunosuppressed patients and in those with multiple underlying
      conditions. In conclusion, FMT appears to be safe and effective in
      eradicating CRE colonization, however, more studies, especially randomized
      trials, are needed to validate the safety and clinical utility of FMT for
      CRE eradication.

AB  - In the following systematic review and meta-analyses, we report several
      conclusions about resistance to carbapenem and polymyxin last-resort
      antibiotics for treating multidrug-resistant bacterial infections among
      pregnant women and infants. Resistance to carbapenems and polymyxins is
      increasing, even in otherwise vulnerable groups such as pregnant women,
      toddlers, and infants, for whom therapeutic options are limited. In almost
      all countries, carbapenem-/polymyxin-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae,
      Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii infect and/or colonize
      neonates and pregnant women, causing periodic outbreaks with very high
      infant mortalities. Downregulation of plasmid-borne bla(NDM) , bla(KPC) ,
      bla(OXA-48) , bla(IMP,) bla(VIM) , bla(GES-5) , and ompK35/36 in clonal
      strains accelerates the horizontal and vertical transmissions of
      carbapenem resistance among these pathogens. New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase
      (NDM)-positive isolates in infants/neonates have been mainly detected in
      China and India, while OXA-48-positive isolates in infants/neonates have
      been mainly detected in Africa. NDM-positive isolates in pregnant women
      have been found only in Madagascar. Antibiotic therapy, prolonged
      hospitalization, invasive procedures, mechanical ventilation, low birth
      weight, and preterm delivery have been common risk factors associated with
      carbapenem/polymyxin resistance. The use of polymyxins to treat
      carbapenem-resistant infections may be selecting for resistance to both
      agents, restricting therapeutic options for infected infants and pregnant
      women. Currently, low- and middle-income countries have the highest burden
      of these pathogens. Antibiotic stewardship, periodic rectal and vaginal
      screening, and strict infection control practices in neonatal ICUs are
      necessary to forestall future outbreaks and deaths.

AB  - BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Rapid and accurate identification of pathogens and
      their antibiotic resistance directly from flagged blood cultures can aid
      clinicians in optimizing early antibiotic treatment and improve the
      clinical outcomes, especially in settings associated with high rates of
      bloodstream infection caused by vancomycin-resistant Enterococci (VRE) and
      carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). We compared the results of
      the BioFire FilmArray Blood Culture Identification (BCID) panel with those
      of conventional methods for identifying the pathogens and their antibiotic
      susceptibility status. METHODS: In total, 100 randomly selected positive
      blood cultures (BACTEC Plus Aerobic/F bottles or BACTEC Anaerobic Lytic/10
      bottles) were analyzed. The pathogen detection efficiency of FilmArray
      BCID panel was compared with that of conventional method using MALDI-TOF
      MS system (Bruker MALDI Biotyper) and susceptibility testing by the Vitek
      2 system. The sequencing analysis of antibiotic resistance genes was
      performed for discrepant results obtained from MALDI Biotyper and Vitek 2.
      RESULTS: Among the 100 positively flagged blood cultures, 94% of FilmArray
      BCID panel results were consistent with the MALDI Biotyper results. All
      five VRE isolates positive for vanA/vanB genes, 10 of 12 Staphylococcus
      species positive for mecA gene, and only one Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate
      positive for K. pneumoniae carbapenemase gene (bla(KPC)) detected in the
      FilmArray BCID panel were also concordant with results by the results by
      conventional susceptibility testing/molecular confirmation. CONCLUSIONS:
      The FilmArray BCID panel results not only demonstrated good correlation
      with conventional blood culture identification and susceptibility results
      but also provided results rapidly, especially for the early detection of
      MRSA, VRE and bla(KPC)-mediated CRE.

AB  - Phaeanthus ophthalmicus (Roxb. ex G.Don) J.Sinclair (previously known as
      P. ebracteolatus (Presl) Merr) is a Philippine medicinal plant occurring
      as evergreen shrub in the lowland forests of Luzon islands. It is used
      traditionally by Filipinos to treat bacterial conjunctivitis, ulcer and
      wound infections. Based on previous investigations where cyclooxygenase-2
      (COX-2) functions as immune-linked factor in infectious sensitivities to
      bacterial pathogens by triggering pro-inflammatory immune-associated
      reactions, we investigated the antimicrobial and COX inhibitory activities
      of the extracts and tetrahydrobisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids of P.
      ophthalmicus in vitro and in silico to validate its ethnomedicinal uses.
      Thus, the dichloromethane-methanol (DCM-MeOH) crude extract and alkaloid
      extracts exhibiting antibacterial activities against drug-resistant
      bacterial strains such as methicillin-resistance Staphylococcus aureus
      (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE), Klebsiella pneumoniae +
      CRE and Pseudomonas aeruginosa + MBL afforded (+)-tetrandrine (1) and
      (+)-limacusine (2) as the major biologically active
      tetrahydrobisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloidal constituents after
      purification. Both tetrahydrobisbenzylisoquinoline alkaloids 1 and 2
      showed broad spectrum antibacterial activity with strongest inhibition
      against the Gram-negative bacteria MβL-Pseudomonas aeruginosa Klebsiella
      pneumoniae + CRE. Interestingly, the alkaloid limacusine (2) showed
      selective inhibition against ovine COX-2 in vitro. These results were
      ascertained by molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulation
      experiments where alkaloid 2 showed strong affinity in the catalytic sites
      of Gram-negative bacterial enzymes P. aeruginosa elastase and K.
      pneumoniae KPC-2 carbapenemase (enzymes involved in infectivity
      mechanisms), and of ovine COX-2. Overall, our study provides credence on
      the ethnomedicinal use of the Philippine medicinal plant P. ophthalmicus
      as traditional plant-based adjuvant to treat bacterial conjunctivitis and
      other related infections. The antibacterial activities and selective COX-2
      inhibition observed for limacusine (2) point to its role as the
      biologically active constituent of P. ophthalmicus. A limited number of
      drugs with COX-2 inhibitory properties like celecoxib also confer
      antibacterial activity. Thus, tetrahydrobisbenzyl alkaloids, especially 2,
      are promising pharmaceutical inspirations for developing treatments of
      bacterial/inflammation-related infections.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Infection with carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) is
      associated with a high mortality rate in kidney transplant recipients, and
      colonization with CRE is one of the major risk factors for CRE infection.
      There is, therefore, a need to improve the capacity to detect colonization
      with CRE among inpatients. METHODS: In this prospective study, we compared
      the performance of real-time PCR for carbapenemase directly from rectal
      swabs with that of conventional CRE surveillance culture in all patients
      admitted to a kidney transplant ward between February 2019 and March 2020.
      Surveillance culture and real-time PCR were performed at admission and
      weekly until hospital discharge. Two perineum-rectal swabs were collected:
      one for culture and one for PCR. RESULTS: We collected 905 paired samples
      for CRE surveillance from 399 patients, of whom 347 (87.0%) were kidney
      transplant recipients and 52 were waiting list patients. CRE was detected
      by culture and/or PCR in 75 patients (18.8%). Positivity for CRE was
      identified by PCR in 62 (15.5%) of the 399 patients and by culture in 55
      (13.8%); 20 (5.0%) of the patients tested positive only on PCR, and 13
      (3.3%) tested positive only on culture. The most common carbapenemase and
      species were, respectively, bla(KPC) (in 85.5%) and Klebsiella pneumoniae
      (in 80.0%). Infection with CRE occurred in 21.6% of the colonized
      patients, those cases occurred only among kidney transplant recipients.
      None of the patients who tested negative on culture developed CRE
      infection. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the two methods are complementary
      and could be useful in a scenario of high CRE prevalence.

AB  - Increasing carbapenem resistance rates worldwide underscored the urgent
      need of novel antimicrobials. Ceftazidime-avibactam and
      aztreonam-avibactam combinations are developed to combat carbapenem
      resistance, but biological and geographic variations must be considered
      for antibiotic susceptibility patterns varied. Thus, we sought to assess
      the susceptibilities of ceftazidime-avibactam and aztreonam-avibactam
      against 660 carbapenem-nonsusceptible Enterobacteriaceae isolates (472
      Klebsiella pneumoniae and 188 Escherichia coli) collected during an
      earlier Taiwan surveillance study. Agar dilution method was used to
      determine ceftazidime-avibactam and aztreonam-avibactam susceptibility.
      Metallo-carbapenemase's contribution to resistance were investigated with
      EDTA addition. The in vivo efficacies were evaluated using a
      Caenorhabditis elegans model. High susceptibility rates were observed for
      ceftazidime-avibactam and aztreonam-avibactam against the 472
      carbapenem-nonsusceptible K. pneumoniae (CnsKP) (85.2% and 95.3%,
      respectively) and 188 carbapenem-nonsusceptible E. coli (CnsEC) isolates
      (91.5% and 94.1%, respectively). For non-metallo-carbapenemase producers,
      the susceptibility rates for ceftazidime-avibactam were 93.6% for CnsKP
      and 97.7% for CnsEC, whereas only 7.1% CnsKP and 11.1% CnsEC in
      metallo-carbapenemase producers were susceptible to ceftazidime-avibactam.
      Of all isolates, 95.3% CnsKP and 94.1% CnsEC were susceptible to
      aztreonam-avibactam. In C. elegans model, ceftazidime-avibactam and
      aztreonam-avibactam revealed effective against a bla(KPC)-producing K.
      pneumoniae isolate in vivo. Our results propose a positive therapeutic
      approach for both combinations against carbapenem-nonsusceptible
      Enterobacteriaceae in Taiwan.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) infections
      have a major effect on mortality as well as healthcare cost. Intensive
      care units (ICUs) in India, the epicenters for multidrug-resistant
      organisms, are facing a "postantibiotic era" because of very limited
      treatment options. A latest beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor
      ceftazidime-avibactam (CZA) new has a broad-spectrum antibacterial
      activity. CZA inhibits class-A and class-C beta-lactamases (as well
      Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)), along with some class-D
      carbapenems such as OXA-48-like enzymes that are seen in
      Enterobacteriaceae has recently become available. The current study aimed
      to assess and present the clinical response and patient outcome with
      infections due to CRE when treated with CZA alone or in combination with
      other drugs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study reviews the
      experience recorded and analyzed at two tertiary care centers including
      only adult patients with CRE infection who had received CZA alone or in
      combination with other antibiotics over a period between February 2019 and
      January 2020. RESULTS: In the period from February 2019 to January 2020,
      119 culture-confirmed CRE isolates were tested for Xpert Carba-R. The
      predominant genetic mechanism was a combination of NDM+OXA-48 in 45/119
      (37.81%). Total 40/57 patients received CZA+aztreonam alone or in
      combination with other drugs with an overall cure rate of 77.5% while the
      rest 17 received CZA alone in combination with the cure rate of 82.35%.
      41/57 (71.92%) patients were in ICU. CONCLUSION: With overall mortality of
      21%, these data suggest that CZA is a viable option for patients with CRE
      infections. To our knowledge, this is the first Indian study reporting CZA
      data in CRE infections. HOW TO CITE THIS ARTICLE: Nagvekar V, Shah A,

      Inhibitors for Controlling Bacterial Carbapenem Resistance

AB  - Production of metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs), which hydrolyze carbapenems, is
      a cause of carbapenem resistance in Enterobacteriaceae Development of
      effective inhibitors for MBLs is one approach to restore carbapenem
      efficacy in carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE). We report here
      that sulfamoyl heteroarylcarboxylic acids (SHCs) can competitively inhibit
      the globally spreading and clinically relevant MBLs (i.e., IMP-, NDM-, and
      VIM-type MBLs) at nanomolar to micromolar orders of magnitude. Addition of
      SHCs restored meropenem efficacy against 17/19 IMP-type and 7/14 NDM-type
      MBL-producing Enterobacteriaceae to satisfactory clinical levels. SHCs
      were also effective against IMP-type MBL-producing Acinetobacter spp. and
      engineered Escherichia coli strains overproducing individual minor MBLs
      (i.e., TMB-2, SPM-1, DIM-1, SIM-1, and KHM-1). However, SHCs were less
      effective against MBL-producing Pseudomonas aeruginosa Combination therapy
      with meropenem and SHCs successfully cured mice infected with
      IMP-1-producing E. coli and dually NDM-1/VIM-1-producing Klebsiella
      pneumoniae clinical isolates. X-ray crystallographic analyses revealed the
      inhibition mode of SHCs against MBLs; the sulfamoyl group of SHCs
      coordinated to two zinc ions, and the carboxylate group coordinated to one
      zinc ion and bound to positively charged amino acids Lys224/Arg228
      conserved in MBLs. Preclinical testing revealed that the SHCs showed low
      toxicity in cell lines and mice and high stability in human liver
      microsomes. Our results indicate that SHCs are promising lead compounds
      for inhibitors of MBLs to combat MBL-producing CRE.IMPORTANCE Carbapenem
      antibiotics are the last resort for control of severe infectious diseases,
      bloodstream infections, and pneumonia caused by Gram-negative bacteria,
      including Enterobacteriaceae However, carbapenem-resistant
      Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) strains have spread globally and are a critical
      concern in clinical settings because CRE infections are recognized as a
      leading cause of increased mortality among hospitalized patients. Most CRE
      produce certain kinds of serine carbapenemases (e.g., KPC- and GES-type
      β-lactamases) or metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs), which can hydrolyze
      carbapenems. Although effective MBL inhibitors are expected to restore
      carbapenem efficacy against MBL-producing CRE, no MBL inhibitor is
      currently clinically available. Here, we synthesized
      2,5-diethyl-1-methyl-4-sulfamoylpyrrole-3-carboxylic acid (SPC), which is
      a potent inhibitor of MBLs. SPC is a remarkable lead compound for
      clinically useful MBL inhibitors and can potentially provide a
      considerable benefit to patients receiving treatment for lethal infectious
      diseases caused by MBL-producing CRE.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore the in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility among
      clinically important Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) in Taiwan. METHODS: From
      2016 through 2018, a total of 5458 GNB isolates, including Escherichia
      coli (n = 1545), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1255), Enterobacter species (n
      = 259), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1127), Acinetobacter baumannii complex
      (n = 368), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 179), were collected. The
      susceptibility results were summarized by the breakpoints of minimum
      inhibitory concentration (MIC) of CLSI 2020, EUCAST 2020 (for colistin),
      or published articles (for ceftolozane/tazobactam). The resistance genes
      among multidrug-resistant (MDR) or extensively drug-resistant (XDR)-GNB
      were investigated by multiplex PCR. RESULTS: Significantly higher rates of
      non-susceptibility (NS) to ertapenem and carbapenemase production,
      predominantly KPC and OXA-48-like beta-lactamase, were observed in
      Enterobacterales isolates causing respiratory tract infection than those
      causing complicated urinary tract or intra-abdominal infection
      (12.7%/3.44% vs. 5.7%/0.76% or 7.7%/0.97%, respectively). Isolates of
      Enterobacter species showed higher rates of phenotypic extended-spectrum
      β-lactamase and NS to ertapenem than E. coli or K. pneumoniae isolates.
      Although moderate activity (54-83%) was observed against most potential
      AmpC-producing Enterobacterales isolates, ceftolozane/tazobactam exhibited
      poor in vitro (44.7-47.4%) activity against phenotypic AmpC Enterobacter
      cloacae isolates. Additionally, 251 (22.3%) P. aeruginosa isolates
      exhibited the carbapenem-NS phenotype, and their MDR and XDR rate was
      63.3% and 33.5%, respectively. Fifteen (75%) of twenty Burkholderia
      cenocepacia complex isolates were inhibited by ceftolozane/tazobactam at
      MICs of ≤4 μg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: With the increase in antibiotic resistance
      in Taiwan, it is imperative to periodically monitor the susceptibility
      profiles of clinically important GNB.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Enterobacterales and other non-fermenting Gram-negative
      bacteria have become a threat worldwide owing to the frequency of
      multidrug resistance in these pathogens. On the other hand, efficacious
      therapeutic options are quickly diminishing. The aims of this study were
      to describe the susceptibility of 50 multiresistant Gram-negative
      bacteria, mostly pan-resistant, against old and less-used antimicrobial
      drugs and to investigate the presence of antimicrobial resistance genes.
      METHODS: A total of 50 genetically distinct isolates were included in this
      study, including 14 Acinetobacter baumannii (belonging to ST79, ST317,
      ST835 and ST836), 1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa (ST245), 8 Serratia marcescens
      and 27 Klebsiella pneumoniae (belonging to ST11, ST340, ST258, ST16, ST23,
      ST25, ST101, ST234, ST437 and ST442). The isolates were submitted to
      antimicrobial susceptibility testing and whole-genome sequencing to
      evaluate lineages and resistance genes. RESULTS: Our results showed that
      some strains harboured carbapenemase genes, e.g. bla(KPC-2) (28/50; 56%)
      and bla(OXA-23) (11/50; 22%), and other resistance genes encoding
      aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes (49/50; 98%). Susceptibility rates to
      tigecycline (96%) in all species (except P. aeruginosa), to minocycline
      (100%) and doxycycline (93%) in A. baumannii, to ceftazidime/avibactam in
      S. marcescens (100%) and K. pneumoniae (96%), and to fosfomycin in S.
      marcescens (88%) were high. Chloramphenicol and quinolones (6%
      susceptibility each) did not perform well, making their use in an
      empirical scenario unlikely. CONCLUSIONS: This study involving genetically
      distinct bacteria showed promising results for tigecycline for all
      Gram-negative bacteria (except P. aeruginosa), and there was good activity
      of minocycline against A. baumannii, ceftazidime/avibactam against
      Enterobacterales, and fosfomycin against S. marcescens.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: There is very limited information about OXA-48-producing
      Klebsiella oxytoca. The aim of this study was to describe the phenotypic
      and molecular characterization of OXA-48-producing K. oxytoca isolates
      that caused an outbreak in a hospital in Tunisia. METHODS: Nineteen
      OXA-48-producing K. oxytoca were isolated from 2013 to 2016 in the
      University Hospital Farhat Hached, Sousse, Tunisia. Antibiotic
      susceptibility testing was performed by broth microdilution. Carbapenemase
      activity was investigated using the modified carbapenem inactivation
      method (mCIM). Phenotypic tests were also carried out to detect
      extended-spectrum β-lactamases. PCR was used to test for the presence of
      carbapenemase genes (bla(IMP), bla(VIM), bla(NDM), bla(SPM), bla(AIM),
      bla(DIM), bla(GIM), bla(SIM), bla(KPC), bla(BIC) and bla(OXA-48)). Genetic
      relatedness among isolates was investigated using rep-PCR. Whole genome
      sequencing (WGS) was performed in three representative isolates. RESULTS:
      mCIM was positive in all isolates. None of the isolates presented an ESBL
      phenotype. All strains were susceptible to cefoxitin, ceftazidime,
      cefepime, aztreonam, imipenem, meropenem, fluoroquinolones,
      aminoglycosides and colistin, and resistant to piperacillin-tazobactam,
      ertapenem, ticarcillin and ampicillin-sulbactam. All isolates presented
      the bla(OXA-48) gene located in a ca. 63 kb IncL plasmid, which carried no
      additional resistance genes. They belonged to the new ST220. CONCLUSION:
      Isolates from this study did not co-express an ESBL, which could
      complicate their detection in clinical laboratories. As OXA-48 has been
      mostly reported in K. pneumoniae there is a risk that the production of
      this enzyme is not suspected in the less common species K. oxytoca. These
      difficulties could play an important role in the hidden spread of this
      enzyme.

AB  - Prompt implementation of appropriate targeted antibiotic therapy
      represents a valuable approach in improving clinical and ecological
      outcome in critically septic patients. This multidisciplinary opinion
      article focused at developing evidence-based algorithms for targeted
      antibiotic therapy of bloodstream (BSIs), complicated urinary tract
      (cUTIs), and complicated intrabdominal infections (cIAIs) caused by
      Enterobacterales. The aim was to provide a guidance for intensive care
      physicians either in appropriately placing novel antibiotics or in
      considering strategies for sparing the broadest-spectrum antibiotics. A
      multidisciplinary team of experts (one intensive care physician, one
      infectious disease consultant, one clinical microbiologist and one MD
      clinical pharmacologist), performed several rounds of assessment to reach
      agreement in developing six different algorithms according to the
      susceptibility pattern (one each for multi-susceptible, extended-spectrum
      beta-lactamase-producing, AmpC beta-lactamase-producing, Klebsiella
      pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-producing, OXA-48-producing, and
      Metallo-beta-lactamase (MBL)-producing Enterobacterales). Whenever
      multiple therapeutic options were feasible, a hierarchical scale was
      established. Recommendations on antibiotic dosing optimization were also
      provided. In order to retrieve evidence-based support for the therapeutic
      choices proposed in the algorithms, a comprehensive literature search was
      performed by a researcher on PubMed-MEDLINE from inception until March
      2021. Quality and strength of evidence was established according to a
      hierarchical scale of the study design. Only articles published in English
      were included. It is expected that these algorithms, by allowing prompt
      revision of antibiotic regimens whenever feasible, appropriate place in
      therapy of novel beta-lactams, implementation of strategies for sparing
      the broadest-spectrum antibiotics, and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic
      optimization of antibiotic dosing regimens, may be helpful either in
      improving clinical outcome or in containing the spread of antimicrobial
      resistance.

AB  - Between August 2018 and June 2019, a river system in Germany that supplies
      a drinking water reservoir and is subject to the discharge from two sewage
      treatment plants was monitored for antibiotic residues via liquid
      chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry, antibiotic resistance genes
      (including bla(NDM), bla(VIM), bla(OXA-48), bla(KPC), bla(GIM), bla(SME),
      bla(IMI), bla(IMP), bla(SPM), bla(SIM), bla(OXA-23), bla(OXA-24),
      bla(OXA-51), bla(OXA-58), mcr) via qualitative real-time PCR and
      antibiotic-resistant bacteria [belonging to the ESKAPE-group (Enterococcus
      faecium, Staphyhlococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter
      baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter ssp.; with resistance
      against Carbapenemases, Cephalosporines and Colistin) and Escherichia
      coli] based on cultivation methods followed by a characterization via
      MALDI-TOF MS and susceptibility testing applying microdilution. Residues
      of macrolide antibiotics such as clarithromycin (up to 0.60 μg/L) and
      residues of sulfamethoxazole (up to 0.40 μg/L) and trimethoprim (up to
      0.39 μg/L) were detected downstream of the sewage treatment plants. In
      addition, no antibiotic residues were detected upstream the respective
      sewage treatment plants, except for anhydroerythromycin (n = 1, <LOQ). In
      total, bla(OXA-58) was found in 6, and mcr in one water sample throughout
      the whole sample period. No MRSA, extensively drug-resistant or
      pan-resistant bacteria, according to Magiorakos et al. (2011), could be
      isolated. In contrast, multidrug-resistant bacteria, especially E. coli
      and Enterococcus faecium were found. In conclusion, sewage treatment plant
      effluents are point sources for antibiotic residues (p = 0.0000 and p =
      0.0001) and antibiotic-resistant bacteria (p = 0.0021 and p = 0.0060)
      since their concentrations increased significantly after the discharge of
      treated wastewater into the investigated rivers. In this specific
      catchment area, which lacked clinical, hospitals, and intensive livestock
      farming, no significant bacterial or analyzed chemical (antibiotic
      residues) influences of the sewage treatment plants were observed in the
      river downstream of the drinking water reservoir during the study.
      Furthermore, no increased selection pressure could be expected as no
      measured antibiotic residues exceeded the predicted no effect
      concentration for antibiotic resistance selection, according to
      Bengtsson-Palme and Larsson (2016).

AB  - BACKGROUND: Sepsis is an overwhelming and life-threatening response to
      bacteria in bloodstream and a major cause of neonatal morbidity and
      mortality. Understanding the etiology and potential risk factors for
      neonatal sepsis is urgently required, particularly in low-income countries
      where burden of infection is high and its epidemiology is poorly
      understood. METHODS: A prospective observational cohort study was
      conducted between April 2016 and October 2017 in a level three NICU at a
      tertiary care hospital in Nepal to determine the bacterial etiology and
      potential risk factors for neonatal sepsis. RESULTS: Among 142 NICU
      admitted neonates, 15% (21/142) and 32% (46/142) developed blood
      culture-positive and -negative neonatal sepsis respectively. Klebsiella
      pneumoniae (34%, 15/44) and Enterobacter spp. (25%, 11/44) were the most
      common isolates. The antimicrobial resistance of isolates to ampicillin
      (100%, 43/43), cefotaxime (74%, 31/42) and ampicillin-sulbactam (55%,
      21/38) were the highest. Bla(TEM) (53%, 18/34) and bla(KPC) (46%, 13/28)
      were the commonest ESBL and carbapenemase genes respectively. In
      univariate logistic regression, the odds of sepsis increased with each
      additional day of use of invasive procedures such as mechanical
      ventilation (OR 1.086, 95% CI 1.008-1.170), umbilical artery catheter (OR
      1.375, 95% CI 1.049-1.803), intravenous cannula (OR 1.140, 95% CI
      1.062-1.225); blood transfusion events (OR 3.084, 95% CI 1.407-6.760);
      NICU stay (OR 1.109, 95% CI 1.040-1.182) and failure to breast feed (OR
      1.130, 95% CI 1.060-1.205). Sepsis odds also increased with leukopenia (OR
      1.790, 95% CI 1.04-3.082), increase in C-reactive protein (OR 1.028, 95%
      CI 1.016-1.040) and decrease in platelets count (OR 0.992, 95% CI
      0.989-0.994). In multivariate analysis, increase in IV cannula insertion
      days (OR 1.147, 95% CI 1.039-1.267) and CRP level (OR 1.028, 95% CI
      1.008-1.049) increased the odds of sepsis. CONCLUSIONS: Our study
      indicated various nosocomial risk factors and underscored the need to
      improve local infection control measures so as to reduce the existing
      burden of sepsis. We have highlighted certain sepsis associated laboratory
      parameters along with identification of antimicrobial resistance genes,
      which can guide for early and better therapeutic management of sepsis.
      These findings could be extrapolated to other low-income settings within
      the region.

AB  - The objective of this research was to evaluate the correlation between
      inhibitory zones and MIC when testing ceftazidime-avibactam using disk
      diffusion, Etest, and broth microdilution method established by the
      Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI). Four-hundred and 58
      isolates of Enterobacterales isolated from 54 medical centers from the
      China Antimicrobial Surveillance Network (CHINET) in 2016 to 2020 were
      collected. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing using broth microdilution,
      Etest, and disk diffusion were performed according to the CLSI. Of the 458
      Enterobacterales, 17.2% (79/458) and 82.8%(379/458) were resistant or
      susceptible to ceftazidime-avibactam by broth microdilution, respectively.
      Compared with the broth microdilution method, the categorical agreement
      (CA) and essential agreement (EA) of the Etest were 99.6% (456/458) and
      94.8% (434/458), respectively; the major error (ME) and very major error
      (VME) were both 0.2% (1/458). For disk diffusion, the CA and VME were
      99.8% (457/458) and 0.2% (1/458), respectively. For Escherichia coli, the
      CA and EA of the Etest were 100% and 97.1% (135/139), respectively. The CA
      of the disk diffusion was 100%. For Klebsiella pneumoniae, the CA and EA
      of the Etest were 99.3% (288/290) and 93.4% (271/290), respectively, the
      ME and VME were both 0.3% (1/290). The CA and VME of disk diffusion were
      99.7% (289/290) and 0.3% (1/290), respectively. For other
      Enterobacterales, the CA and EA of the Etest were 100% and 96.6% (28/29),
      respectively. The CA of the disk diffusion was 100%. Ceftazidime-avibactam
      disk diffusion (30/20-μg disks) and Etest demonstrated good performance
      for ceftazidime-avibactam susceptibility testing against Enterobacterales
      clinical isolates. IMPORTANCE Multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria,
      especially for extended-spectrum β-lactamases-producing and
      carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales, are disseminating rapidly around
      the world. Treatment options for these infections are limited, which
      prompt the development of novel or combinational therapies to combat the
      infections caused by multidrug-resistant pathogens. The newly available
      β-lactam combination agent ceftazidime-avibactam has been demonstrated
      good in vitro and in vivo activity against ESBL, AmpC, KPC-2, or
      OXA-48-like-producing isolates and has shown promise in treating
      carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales infections. Concerningly, there are
      few available automated systems for ceftazidime-avibactam susceptibility
      testing, and the broth microdilution method is hard to perform in most
      routine laboratories. Therefore, we urgently need an economical and
      practical method for the accurate detection of ceftazidime-avibactam
      activity against Gram-negative bacilli. Here, we evaluate the performance
      of the disk diffusion and Etest compared with the reference broth
      microdilution method against Enterobacterales clinical strains.

AB  - Early development of the microbiome has been shown to affect general
      health and physical development of the infant and, although some studies
      have been undertaken in high-income countries, there are few studies from
      low- and middle-income countries. As part of the BARNARDS study, we
      examined the rectal microbiota of 2,931 neonates (term used up to 60 d)
      with clinical signs of sepsis and of 15,217 mothers screening for
      bla(CTX-M-15), bla(NDM), bla(KPC) and bla(OXA-48)-like genes, which were
      detected in 56.1%, 18.5%, 0% and 4.1% of neonates' rectal swabs and 47.1%,
      4.6%, 0% and 1.6% of mothers' rectal swabs, respectively.
      Carbapenemase-positive bacteria were identified by MALDI-TOF MS and showed
      a high diversity of bacterial species (57 distinct species/genera) which
      exhibited resistance to most of the antibiotics tested. Escherichia coli,
      Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae/E. cloacae complex, the
      most commonly found isolates, were subjected to whole-genome sequencing
      analysis and revealed close relationships between isolates from different
      samples, suggesting transmission of bacteria between neonates, and between
      neonates and mothers. Associations between the carriage of antimicrobial
      resistance genes (ARGs) and healthcare/environmental factors were
      identified, and the presence of ARGs was a predictor of neonatal sepsis
      and adverse birth outcomes.
