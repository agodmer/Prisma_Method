AB  - Ceftazidime is a 3rd generation cephalosporin active against Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa. Avibactam is an inhibitor of class A, C and some class D
      β-lactamases. The antibacterial spectrum of ceftazidime-avibactam covers
      95% of P. aeruginosa isolates and >99% of enterobacteria, including
      strains carrying extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs). Selection of
      resistant mutants in Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae
      strains producing KPC-3 or KPC-2 after exposure to ceftazidime-avibactam
      has been described by the appearance of one or more amino acid changes in
      the Ω-loop of the β-lactamase. These strains usually regain susceptibility
      to meropenem. There is evidence of a shorter multidrug-resistant organisms
      colonization period in patients treated with this antimicrobial, which
      could be beneficial in the treatment of infections caused by bacteria
      carrying ESBLs or carbapenemases.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cefiderocol is a novel siderophore cephalosporin, developed
      for activity against MDR Gram-negative bacilli (MDR-GNB). OBJECTIVES: To
      assess the in vitro antibacterial activity of cefiderocol against a
      collection of MDR-GNB clinical isolates from hospitals in southern Spain.
      METHODS: Two hundred and thirty-one isolates of successful clones were
      tested: 125 Enterobacterales (121 ESBL- and/or carbapenemase-producing
      Klebsiella pneumoniae and 4 carbapenemase-producing Enterobacter cloacae),
      80 Acinetobacter baumannii, 6 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 20
      Stenotrophomonas maltophilia. Ceftolozane/tazobactam, ceftazidime,
      ceftazidime/avibactam, cefepime, aztreonam, meropenem, amikacin,
      ciprofloxacin, colistin and tigecycline were used as comparators against
      Enterobacterales, P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii. Minocycline,
      levofloxacin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole were studied against S.
      maltophilia instead of aztreonam, ciprofloxacin and cefepime. MICs were
      determined by broth microdilution according to CLSI guidelines. MIC
      determination was performed in CAMHB for all antimicrobials except
      cefiderocol, where iron-depleted CAMHB was used. RESULTS: Cefiderocol
      showed potent in vitro activity against the isolates analysed. MIC50 and
      MIC90 values were in the ranges 0.125-8 mg/L and 0.5-8 mg/L, respectively,
      and 98% of isolates were inhibited at ≤4 mg/L. Only five isolates showed
      cefiderocol MICs of >4 mg/L: three ST2/OXA-24/40-producing A. baumannii,
      one ST114/VIM-1-producing E. cloacae and one ST114/VIM-1 +
      OXA-48-producing E. cloacae. All KPC-3-producing K. pneumoniae were
      susceptible to cefiderocol, even those resistant to ceftazidime/avibactam.
      P. aeruginosa isolates showed cefiderocol MICs of <4 mg/L, including those
      resistant to ceftolozane/tazobactam. S. maltophilia isolates displayed
      cefiderocol MICs of <4 mg/L, including those resistant to levofloxacin
      and/or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. CONCLUSIONS: Cefiderocol showed
      excellent activity against MDR-GNB, including carbapenem-resistant
      isolates, and was the most active antimicrobial tested against this
      collection.

TI  - Migration of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae Carbapenemase

AB  - Sink waste traps and drains are a reservoir for multi-drug resistant
      Gram-negative bacteria in the hospital environment. It has been suggested
      that these bacteria can migrate through hospital plumbing. Hospital waste
      traps were installed in a laboratory model system where sinks were
      connected through a common wastewater pipe. Enterobacterales populations
      were monitored using selective culture, MALDI-TOF identification and
      antibiotic resistance profiling before and after a wastewater backflow
      event. When transfer between sinks was suspected, isolates were compared
      using whole-genome sequencing. Immediately after the wastewater backflow,
      two KPC-producing Enterobacter cloacae were recovered from a waste trap in
      which Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) had not been detected
      previously. The isolates belonged to ST501 and ST31 and were genetically
      indistinguishable to those colonising sinks elsewhere in the system.
      Following inter-sink transfer, KPC-producing E. cloacae ST501 successfully
      integrated into the microbiome of the recipient sink and was detected in
      the waste trap water at least five months after the backflow event. Seven
      weeks and three months after the backflow, other inter-sink transfers
      involving Escherichia coli ST5295 and KPC-producing E. cloacae ST501 were
      also observed.

AB  - Enterobacterales clinical isolates are now being resistant to clinically
      achievable concentrations of most commonly used antibiotics that makes
      treatment of hospitalized patients very challenging. We hereby determine
      the molecular characteristics of carbapenemase genes in
      carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) isolates in Taiwan. A total of
      455 CRE isolates were identified between August 2011 to July 2020. Minimum
      inhibitory concentrations for selected carbapenems were tested using Vitek
      2, and carbapenemase genes were determined using polymerase chain reaction
      in combination with sequencing. Phenotypic detection of carbapenemase was
      determined by modified carbapenem inactivation method (mCIM) and
      EDTA-modified carbapenem inactivation method (eCIM) to validate our PCR
      screening results. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was used to
      determine the clonality of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE)
      isolates, and the transferability of carbapenemase-carrying plasmids was
      determined by conjugation assays. A slight increase in
      carbapenem-resistant E. coli (CREC) was observed, however, the prevalence
      of carbapenem-resistant K. pneumoniae (CRKP) was steady, during 2011-2020.
      The dominant species among our CRE was K. pneumoniae (270/455, 59.3%),
      followed by E. coli (81/455, 17.8%), Morganella morganii (32/455, 7.0%),
      and Enterobacter cloacae (25/455, 5.5%). From 2011 to 2020, the total
      percentage of CPE increased steadily, accounting for 61.0% of CRE in 2020.
      Moreover, 122 of 455 CRE isolates (26.8%) were CPE. Among the CPE
      isolates, the dominant carbapenemase gene was bla (OXA-48-like) (54/122,
      44.3%), and the second most common carbapenemase gene was bla (KPC-2)
      (47/122, 38.5%). The sensitivity and specificity for mCIM to detect
      carbapenemase in the 455 isolates were both 100% in this study. The PFGE
      results showed that 39 carbapenemase-producing E. coli and 69
      carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae isolates carrying bla (KPC-2) and/or
      bla (NDM-5) could be classified into 5 and 12 clusters, respectively. In
      conclusion, our results showed an increase in CPE isolates in Taiwan.
      Moreover, the distribution of carbapenemase and antimicrobial
      susceptibility in CPE were associated with PFGE typing.

      potential to become a high-risk clone

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Enterobacter cloacae complex (ECC) has awakened interest
      recently because of its increasing resistance to carbapenems codified by
      several genes all over the globe. Even though there are some sequence
      types (STs) which represent high-risk clones, there is substantial clonal
      diversity in the ECC. This work aimed to perform whole-genome sequencing
      (WGS), genomic analysis, and phylogenetic studies of a Klebsiella
      pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) -producing multidrug-resistant (MDR) ECC
      isolate from Argentina. METHODS: We analysed the genome of an MDR
      KPC-producing ECC strain isolated from a urine sample from a patient in a
      hospital in Argentina. The WGS was done by Illumina MiSeq-I (Illumina, San
      Diego, CA). The genome was assembled with SPAdes 3.9.0, and annotated with
      PROKKA, RAST, and Blast. Plasmids were identified with PlasmidFinder.
      Antibiotic resistance genes were detected using RESfinder, CARD, and
      Blastn. STs were identified with pubMLST. RESULTS: The strain was
      identified as Enterobacter hormaechei, an important emerging human
      pathogen. No ST could be assigned; six of seven alleles of multilocus
      sequence typing (MLST) were the same as for E. hormaechei ST66, which is a
      high-risk clone. We found multiple acquired antibiotic resistance genes,
      including bla(KPC-2) in an IncM1 plasmid, and a secretion system VI, which
      can favour the prevalence of ECC strains while competing with other
      bacteria. CONCLUSION: Because of its MLST profile being so close to that
      of E. hormaechei ST66, the acquisition of multiple resistance genes, and
      the presence of the secretion systems, the potential of this strain for
      becoming a new high-risk clone cannot be discarded.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with COVID-19 may be at increased risk for secondary
      bacterial infections with MDR pathogens, including carbapenemase-producing
      Enterobacterales (CPE). OBJECTIVES: We sought to rapidly investigate the
      clinical characteristics, population structure and mechanisms of
      resistance of CPE causing secondary infections in patients with COVID-19.
      METHODS: We retrospectively identified CPE clinical isolates collected
      from patients testing positive for SARS-CoV-2 between March and April 2020
      at our medical centre in New York City. Available isolates underwent
      nanopore sequencing for rapid genotyping, antibiotic resistance gene
      detection and phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: We identified 31 CPE
      isolates from 13 patients, including 27 Klebsiella pneumoniae and 4
      Enterobacter cloacae complex isolates. Most patients (11/13) had a
      positive respiratory culture and 7/13 developed bacteraemia; treatment
      failure was common. Twenty isolates were available for WGS. Most K.
      pneumoniae (16/17) belonged to ST258 and encoded KPC (15 KPC-2; 1 KPC-3);
      one ST70 isolate encoded KPC-2. E. cloacae isolates belonged to ST270 and
      encoded NDM-1. Nanopore sequencing enabled identification of at least four
      distinct ST258 lineages in COVID-19 patients, which were validated by
      Illumina sequencing data. CONCLUSIONS: While CPE prevalence has declined
      substantially in New York City in recent years, increased detection in
      patients with COVID-19 may signal a re-emergence of these highly resistant
      pathogens in the wake of the global pandemic. Increased surveillance and
      antimicrobial stewardship efforts, as well as identification of optimal
      treatment approaches for CPE, will be needed to mitigate their future
      impact.

AB  - Enterobacterales co-producing carbapenemases have awakened health alerts
      in Latin America. Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales harboring KPC
      and NDM-1 are resistant to almost all existing antibiotics. Panama reports
      KPC since 2010, and NDM since 2011, however, Enterobacterales with double
      carbapenemase production is new to our hospitals. We present the first two
      isolates of Enterobacter cloacae complex co-producing KPC and NDM, in a
      second level hospital in Panama City. Strengthening epidemiological
      surveillance systems in hospitals allows to carry out timely detection of
      these new combinations of resistance; to implement outbreak prevention and
      control measures.

AB  - Carbapenemase production is constantly increasing among different
      Enterobacterales species. We analyzed the microbiological characteristics
      and population structure of all carbapenemase-producing Enterobacter spp.
      (CP-Ent) isolates recovered at the Ramón y Cajal Hospital between 2005 and
      2018. Overall, 178 CP-Ent isolates (60.7% colonization, 39.3% clinical)
      were recovered from 165 hospitalized patients (165/176, 93.7%; medical
      [102/165], surgical [34/165], and intensive care unit [29/165] areas),
      emergency unit (4/176, 2.3%), and ambulatory patients (7/176, 4.0%). In
      addition, three CP-Ent were found in environmental sources. Clinical
      samples were mainly urine (37.1%). The most frequent matrix-assisted laser
      desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF)-identified species were
      Enterobacter cloacae (n = 85) and Enterobacter asburiae (n = 49). hsp60
      gene sequencing showed a higher species diversity than MALDI-TOF: 70
      Enterobacter hormaechei-clusters III, VI, VIII; 69 Enterobacter
      roggenkampii-IV; 15 Enterobacter kobei-II; 9 E. asburiae-I; 3 Enterobacter
      ludwigii-V; and 1 E. cloacae subsp. dissolvens-XII. Nine Klebsiella
      aerogenes were also identified. Overall, a high clonal diversity (Simpson
      Diversity Index >0.90) was found among CP-Ent-clusters. Environmental
      isolates were clonally related to clinical ones. Amikacin and tigecycline
      showed the highest susceptibility (>93%). VIM-1 (n = 133/181, 73.5%) and
      OXA-48 (n = 34/181, 18.8%) carbapenemases were predominant, followed by
      KPC-2 (n = 9/181, 5.0%), KPC-3 (n = 2/181, 1.1%), VIM-2 (n = 1/181, 0.6%),
      and two coproducers (VIM-1+KPC-2 and VIM-1+KPC-3). Extended-spectrum
      beta-lactamase (ESBL) coproduction (14.4%) emerged in 2012, mainly
      associated with bla(SHV-12) (p < 0.001), E. roggenkampii (p < 0.001), and
      colonization (p = 0.03). VIM-1- and OXA-48-CP-Ent fecal carriers increased
      in our hospital, particularly between 2011 and 2018 (p < 0.001). Moreover,
      KPC and OXA-48 producers emerged in 2010 and 2012, respectively. They
      superimposed over VIM producers, which were persistently recovered since
      first detection in 2005. These results depict increased complexity over
      time of CP-Ent.

AB  - PURPOSE: The search for new agents to treat multidrug-resistant
      gram-negative bacterial infections has been ongoing. Specifically,
      carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) infections often exhibit
      multiple resistance mechanisms, including alterations in drug structure,
      bacterial efflux pumps, and drug permeability. Vaborbactam, a cyclic
      boronic acid pharmacophore, has the highest potency in vitro with
      meropenem as an inhibitor of class A carbapenemases, including Klebsiella
      pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC). This combination product was approved by
      the US Food and Drug Administration for complicated urinary tract
      infections (cUTIs) in August 2017, and recent Phase III trial data have
      expanded the literature available. This article aimed to describe the
      literature regarding spectrum of activity, dosing and administration,
      including pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics properties, safety profile,
      and efficacy end points. METHODS: The terms meropenem, vaborbactam,
      RPX7009, and meropenem-vaborbactam were used to search for literature via
      PubMed, ClinicalTrials.gov, and published abstracts from 2013 to July
      2019. Abstracts from IDWeek 2019 were also searched via these terms.
      Results were limited to availability in English. FINDINGS:
      Meropenem-vaborbactam covers a spectrum of gram-negative bacterial
      pathogens, including K pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, and Enterobacter
      cloacae complex. Although the addition of vaborbactam to meropenem results
      in MIC lowering for KPC-positive Enterobacteriaceae, in vitro data reveal
      limited activity against resistant strains of Acinetobacter species and
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Data from 2 Phase III studies compare the drug
      with available therapies for the following indications: cUTIs, acute
      pyelonephritis, hospital-acquired and ventilator-acquired bacterial
      pneumonia, bacteremia, and complicated intra-abdominal infections.
      Outcomes include an improvement in clinical success when compared with
      piperacillin-tazobactam (98.4% vs 94%; 95% CI, 0.7%-9.1%; P < 0.001 for
      noninferiority) for overall treatment of cUTIs and acute pyelonephritis
      and clinical cure (64.3% vs 33.3%; P = 0.04) when compared with best
      available therapy for CRE infections in various sites of infection.
      Adverse events have been described as mild to moderate, with few events
      requiring discontinuation of the drug therapy. IMPLICATIONS: Currently,
      meropenem-vaborbactam is approved for treatment of cUTIs and acute
      pyelonephritis; however, off-label use, in particular for CRE infections,
      appears beneficial. Clinical trials to date have found an improvement in
      clinical cure and potentially an improved tolerability compared with
      standard therapies. Most of the evidence for meropenem-vaborbactam
      activity and the role in therapy focuses on KPC-producing organisms;
      however, because in vitro activity has been found with some
      non-KPC-producing CRE, its role may be further described from upcoming in
      vivo cases and postmarketing research.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The emergence and spread of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacter
      cloacae complex (ECC) have posed a serious threat to human health
      worldwide. This study aimed to investigate the molecular mechanism of
      carbapenem resistance and its prevalence among ECC in China. METHODS: A
      total of 1314 ECC clinical isolates were collected from the First
      Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University from 2004 to 2018.
      Sensitivity to antibiotics was determined using the agar dilution method.
      The production of carbapenemases and the prevalence of
      resistance-associated genes were investigated using PCR. The expression of
      outer membrane porin (OMP) genes (ompC/ompF) and cephalosporinase gene
      ampC was analyzed by quantitative real-time PCR. The effect of efflux pump
      mechanism on carbapenem resistance was tested. ECC was typed by multilocus
      sequence typing (MLST). RESULTS: In this study, 113
      carbapenem-nonsusceptible ECC strains were identified. The prevalence
      rates of carbapenemase genes bla (KPC-2) and bla (NDM) were 12.4% (14/113)
      and 17.7% (20/113), and that of the extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)
      genes bla (CTX-M), bla (TEM), and bla (SHV) were 28.3% (32/113), 27.4%
      (31/113), and 14.2% (16/113), respectively. Among 67
      carbapenem-nonsusceptible ECC isolates producing non-carbapenemase, low
      expression of ompC/ompF and overexpression of ampC were found in 46 and 40
      strains, respectively. In addition, the carbapenem resistance was related
      to the overexpression of the efflux pump in the study. Finally, the 113
      carbapenem-nonsusceptible ECC strains were categorized into 39 different
      sequence types using MLST. CONCLUSION: Carbapenem-nonsusceptible ECC
      strains producing non-carbapenemase were predominant. The low expression
      of OMP with the overexpression of cephalosporinase or production of ESBLs
      and overexpression of efflux pump might contribute to the resistance to
      carbapenem for carbapenem-nonsusceptible ECC strains producing
      non-carbapenemase. The bla (NDM) and bla (KPC) comprised the principal
      resistance mechanism of carbapenemase-producing ECC in the hospital,
      causing a threat to public health. Therefore, monitoring programs to
      prevent the emergence and further spread of antibiotic resistance are
      urgently needed.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the antimicrobial susceptibility and resistance
      mechanisms to β-lactams among Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter
      freundii from United States medical centres. METHODS: 2571 E. cloacae and
      1008 C. freundii species complex isolates were consecutively collected
      from 77 medical centres and susceptibility tested by broth microdilution
      method. Isolates displaying MIC values ≥16 mg/L for ceftazidime or ≥2 mg/L
      for cefepime (n = 914) were tested for β-lactamase-encoding genes using
      whole genome sequencing. RESULTS: Overall susceptibility to ceftazidime
      and cefepime were 73.9% and 91.2% among E. cloacae and 74.2% and 93.5%
      among C. freundii, respectively. Sixty-three isolates harboured a
      carbapenemase gene, including 56 bla (KPC), 2 bla (NMC-A), and 5
      metallo-β-lactamase genes. Among non-carbapenemase producers, 121 isolates
      had at least one ESBL-encoding gene, mainly bla (SHV) (81) or bla (CTX-M)
      (61), and 15 had a transferable AmpC gene, mainly bla (DHA-1) (8) or bla
      (FOX-5) (6). Carbapenemase, ESBL, or transferable AmpC-encoding genes were
      not identified among 718 of 914 (78.6%) isolates sequenced. The most
      active agents against isolates with a decreased susceptibility to
      ceftazidime and/or cefepime were ceftazidime/avibactam (MIC(50/90), 0.5/1
      mg/L; 99.3% susceptible), amikacin (MIC(50/90), 1/4 mg/L; 99.5%
      susceptible), and meropenem (MIC(50/90), 0.06/0.5 mg/L; 92.9%
      susceptible). The isolates resistant to ceftazidime/avibactam were the
      five MBL producers and one E. cloacae isolate with a reduced expression of
      OmpF and overexpression of AcrAB-TolC. CONCLUSIONS: Hyperproduction of
      chromosomal AmpC appears to be the most common mechanism of resistance to
      ceftazidime and/or cefepime in E. cloacae and C. freundii.
      Ceftazidime/avibactam remained highly active against most isolates showing
      decreased susceptibility to ceftazidime and/or cefepime.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Infections caused by the carbapenem-resistant Enterobacter
      cloacae (CREC) bring great challenges to the clinical treatment and pose a
      serious threat to public health. In this study, we investigated the
      molecular characteristics of CREC in a tertiary hospital. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: A total of 12 non-duplicate CREC strains isolated during the
      period of November 2016 to July 2019 were subjected to automated microbial
      identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing (AST) using the BD
      Phoenix-100 identification and antimicrobial susceptibility testing
      (ID/AST) system. The strains were also subjected to phenotypic screening
      for the detection of antibiotic resistance genes such as the carbapenemase
      and other β-lactamase genes, with the use of the polymerase chain reaction
      assay (PCR). Finally, multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) and pulsed-field
      gel electrophoresis (PFGE)-based homology analysis were applied. RESULTS:
      Four types of carbapenemases namely IMP-26, NDM-5, NDM-1, and KPC-2 were
      identified in 12 CREC strains. IMP-26 was the most prevalent type (6/12
      strains, 50 %), followed by NDM-5 (3/12 strains, 25 %). The results of
      MLST revealed that these 12 strains could be divided into five sequence
      types (STs) among which ST544 was the dominant type (6/12 strains, 50 %).
      The PFGE results divided the 12 strains into four clusters. CONCLUSION:
      Our study indicated that the epidemics of the IMP-26-producing E. cloacae
      ST544 strain did occur in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a tertiary
      hospital. Therefore, early surveillance and strict implementation of
      control measures are crucial for the prevention of nosocomial infections
      and transmissions in hospitals.

AB  - Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) and carbapenemase-producing
      Enterobacterales (CPE) have become global threats. CRE- and CPE- derived
      infections have been associated with high mortality due to limited
      treatment options. Nacubactam is a β-lactamase inhibitor and belongs to
      the new class of diazabicyclooctane. The agent has an in vitro
      antimicrobial activity against several classes of β-lactamase-producing
      Enterobacterales. This study evaluated antimicrobial activity of
      combination therapies including β-lactams (aztreonam, cefepime, and
      meropenem) and nacubactam against four Enterobacter cloacae and six
      Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates with murine pneumonia model. Based on
      changes in bacterial quantity, antimicrobial activities of some regimens
      were assessed. Combination therapies including β-lactams (aztreonam,
      cefepime, and meropenem) with nacubactam showed enhanced antimicrobial
      activity against CRE E. cloacae (-3.70 to -2.08 Δlog(10) CFU/lungs) and K.
      pneumoniae (-4.24 to 1.47 Δlog(10) CFU/lungs) with IMP-1, IMP-6, or KPC
      genes, compared with aztreonam, cefepime, meropenem, and nacubactam
      monotherapies. Most combination therapies showed bacteriostatic (-3.0 to 0
      Δlog(10) CFU/lungs) to bactericidal (<-3.0 Δlog(10) CFU/lungs) activities
      against CRE isolates. This study revealed that combination regimens with
      β-lactams (aztreonam, cefepime, and meropenem) and nacubactam are
      preferable candidates to treat pneumonia due to CRE and CPE.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Despite the fact that carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales
      (CRE) mostly cause urinary tract infections (UTIs), only few studies have
      focused on the efficacity of mecillinam against these CRE. OBJECTIVES: To
      evaluate the mecillinam susceptibility of a huge collection of CRE,
      including carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) and non-CPE (ESBL
      and AmpC producers with decreased permeability of the outer membrane).
      METHODS: A total of 8310 non-duplicate clinical CRE, including 4042
      OXA-48-like producers, 1094 NDM producers, 411 VIM producers, 174 KPC
      producers, 42 IMI producers, 153 multiple-carbapenemase producers and 45
      isolates producing other types of carbapenemases (such as IMP-like enzymes
      or GES-5), were included in the study. WGS was performed on all CPE using
      Illumina technology. Categorization of susceptibility to mecillinam was
      performed using disc diffusion (mecillinam discs at 10 μg; I2A, France)
      according to EUCAST recommendations. The results were interpreted
      according to EUCAST guidelines (S ≥15 mm). RESULTS: Significantly higher
      susceptibility rates were observed for carbapenem-resistant Proteus spp.
      (85%) and carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli (84%), which are the two
      most common species responsible for UTIs, than for Klebsiella pneumoniae
      (67%), Enterobacter cloacae complex (75%), Citrobacter spp. (65%),
      Serratia spp. (34%) and Morganella morganii (12%). Susceptibility rates
      were 84%, 71% and 91% for OXA-48-like, NDM and IMI producers and 70% for
      non-CPE CRE. Mecillinam was less active against VIM and KPC producers (14%
      and 0%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Mecillinam might be an alternative for
      the treatment of infections due to CRE, particularly UTIs, except for VIM
      and KPC producers and for M. morganii and Serratia spp species.

AB  - Imipenem-relebactam is a novel β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor combination.
      We evaluated the in vitro activity of imipenem-relebactam and comparators
      against Enterobacterales clinical isolates recovered in 8 Spanish and 11
      Portuguese intensive care units (ICUs) (SUPERIOR, 2016-2017; STEP,
      2017-2018). Overall, 747 Enterobacterales isolates (378 Escherichia coli,
      252 Klebsiella spp., 64 Enterobacter spp., and 53 other species) were
      prospectively collected from ICU patients with complicated intraabdominal
      (cIAI), complicated urinary tract (cUTI), and lower respiratory tract
      (LRTI) infections. MICs were determined (ISO-broth microdilution), and
      whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed in a subset of isolates
      displaying susceptible and resistant imipenem-relebactam MICs.
      Imipenem-relebactam (98.7% susceptible) showed similar activity to
      ceftazidime-avibactam (99.5% susceptible) and higher than
      ceftolozane-tazobactam (86.9% susceptible). Imipenem-relebactam was
      inactive against 1.3% (10/747) isolates, all of them due to carbapenemase
      production (9 K. pneumoniae and 1 E. cloacae). Imipenem-relebactam was
      active against 100% of extended-spectrum β-lactamase (ESBL)-E. coli and
      ESBL-Klebsiella spp. isolates and 80.4% of carbapenemase-Klebsiella spp.
      producers. Carbapenemase genes were confirmed by WGS in 41 Klebsiella
      spp.: OXA-48 (20/41), KPC-3 (14/41), OXA-181 (4/41), NDM-1 (1/41), OXA-48
      + VIM-2 (1/41), and KPC-3 + VIM-2 (1/41). In Klebsiella spp. isolates,
      relebactam restored imipenem susceptibility in all KPC-3 producers, and
      resistant isolates (7/41) were mostly OXA-48 + CTX-M-15-K. pneumoniae
      high-risk clones (7/9). Intercountry differences were detected as follows:
      OXA-48 (17/21) was dominant in Spain, unlike KPC-3 (14/15) in Portugal.
      Imipenem-relebactam was 100% active against CTX-M-15-ST131-H30Rx-E. coli
      high-risk clone, predominant in both countries. Our results depict the
      potential role of imipenem-relebactam in ICU patients with cIAIs, cUTIs,
      and LRTIs due to wild-type ESBL- and carbapenemase-producing
      Enterobacterales, particularly KPC producers. IMPORTANCE We comparatively
      evaluate the in vitro activity of a drug combination consisting of a
      carbapenem (imipenem) and a novel inhibitor of beta-lactamases
      (relebactam), a mechanism that destroys beta-lactam antibiotics. We assess
      the activity against a collection of Enterobacterales clinical isolates
      recovered from difficult-to-treat infections in patients admitted to
      different intensive care units in Portugal and Spain. Imipenem-relebactam
      shows excellent activity in avoiding common resistance mechanisms in this
      setting, such as extended-spectrum beta-lactamases and carbapenemases
      widely distributed, including KPCs. We show few resistant isolates (<2%).
      Molecular characterization by whole-genome sequencing shows that most of
      the resistant isolates produced specific carbapenemase, such as OXA-48 or
      metalo-betalactamases. Our study updates the activity of
      imipenem-relebactam in light of current epidemiology in a hospital setting
      in which the use of this combination is needed due to the presence of
      infections due to multidrug-resistant isolates.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Enterobacter cloacae is an emerging opportunistic pathogen. We
      retrospectively conducted a study to assess antimicrobial susceptibility
      and investigated the Molecular characteristics of carbapenem-resistant
      Enterobacter cloacae (CREL) isolates. METHODS: Three hundred forty-two
      isolates of Enterobacter cloacae were collected from January 2014 to
      December 2018. Ten strains of CREL were collected for further research.
      The species identifications and minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs)
      of all antibiotics tested were analyzed using the Vitek 2 Compact system
      (BioMerieux, France) and supplemented by the disk diffusion method.
      Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed to detect extended-spectrum
      β-lactamase (ESBL) and carbapenemase resistance genes. RESULTS: The
      results showed that most of the isolates remained susceptible to tested
      antibiotics; however, the resistance rate of Cefepime has been increasing
      in recent years. One strain co-producing New Delhi Metallo-β-lactamase
      NDM-1 and Imipenem hydrolase IMP-4. NDM-1 and IMP-4-producing isolates
      highlight that active surveillance is necessary to prevent the further
      spread of the bacteria. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) showed that two
      KPC-producing isolates assigned to ST93, two isolates carrying NDM-1
      assigned to ST1120. Moreover, the MEGA analysis showed that ST93, ST256,
      and ST1120 have homology, showing that CREL in our area has a potential
      spread risk. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicating that CREL clonal
      dissemination may occurred in this region and should be taken seriously
      concern. Our study highlights an urgent need to monitor these isolates to
      prevent their further spread.

AB  - Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) are a growing public health
      concern due to resistance to multiple antibiotics and potential to cause
      health care-associated infections with high mortality.
      Carbapenemase-producing CRE are of particular concern given that
      carbapenemase-encoding genes often are located on mobile genetic elements
      that may spread between different organisms and species. In this study, we
      performed phenotypic and genotypic characterization of CRE collected at
      eight U.S. sites participating in active population- and laboratory-based
      surveillance of carbapenem-resistant organisms. Among 421 CRE tested, the
      majority were isolated from urine (n = 349, 83%). Klebsiella pneumoniae
      was the most common organism (n = 265, 63%), followed by Enterobacter
      cloacae complex (n = 77, 18%) and Escherichia coli (n = 50, 12%). Of 419
      isolates analyzed by whole genome sequencing, 307 (73%) harbored a
      carbapenemase gene; variants of bla(KPC) predominated (n = 299, 97%). The
      occurrence of carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae, E. cloacae complex,
      and E. coli varied by region; the predominant sequence type within each
      genus was ST258, ST171, and ST131, respectively. None of the
      carbapenemase-producing CRE isolates displayed resistance to all
      antimicrobials tested; susceptibility to amikacin and tigecycline was
      generally retained.

AB  - This study aimed to determine the incidence and the molecular mechanisms
      of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae in patients from the Sétif
      University Hospital, Algeria. Nonduplicate clinical bacterial isolates
      recovered from patients attending the University Hospital of Sétif were
      collected between April and October 2018. Species identification was
      performed by MALDI-TOF/MS (matrix-assisted laser desorption
      ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry) method. The susceptibility of
      the isolates to carbapenems was determined using the disc diffusion
      method. The carbapenem resistant isolates were screened for the presence
      of common carbapenemase genes (bla(KPC), bla(OXA-48), bla(VIM), bla(IMP),
      and bla(NDM)) and extended-spectrum β-lactamase (bla(CTX), bla(TEM), and
      bla(SHV)) using PCR and sequencing technique. A total of 123 nonrepetitive
      Enterobacteriaceae isolates were obtained. Klebsiella pneumoniae (n =
      52/42.28%), Escherichia coli (n = 24/19.51%), and Enterobacter cloacae (n
      = 19/15.45%) were the most prevalent species. The Carba-NP test showed
      that 6 out of 123 isolates carried carbapenemase enzymes. OXA-48 was found
      in five isolates (four K. pneumoniae and one E. coli) and NDM-5 in one E.
      cloacae isolate. We reported for the first time in Algeria the presence of
      NDM-5 carbapenemase enzyme in a clinical E. cloacae isolate.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The hospital environment can be an important source for the
      transmission of pathogens, However, there are rare reports revealing the
      contamination of carbapenemase-producing enterobacterales (CPE) in the
      hospital environment. The aim of this study was to investigate the
      presence of CPE in hospital environments and their relation to clinical
      strains. METHODS: Environmental samples were collected from three tertiary
      university hospitals between June 2017 and August 2019. The environmental
      samples were inoculated on CHROMagar™ KPC plates. A multiplex PCR and
      sequencing were used for six carbapenemase genes. Multi-locus sequence
      typing (MLST) was performed for CPE of Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia
      coli, and Enterobacter cloacae complex from the environmental and clinical
      specimens. RESULTS: 20 carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE)
      strains were detected in the beds of patients, toilet bowl, sink,
      patient's gown, electromanometer, and keyboard. K. pneumoniae was the most
      common, followed by Serratia marcescens, E. cloacae complex, E. coli, and
      Citrobacter freundii. Nineteen CRE were CPE. Eighteen of 19 CPEs produced
      KPC-2 carbapenemase, and one CPE (E. coli) produced NDM-5. We confirmed
      that the STs of K. pneumoniae-producing KPC-2 (ST 307 and ST11) and E.
      coli producing KPC-2 (ST648) from hospital environment were the same as
      those from patients. CONCLUSION: We believe that the hospital environment
      can be an important route for CPE transmission. Therefore, continuous
      surveillance and management are needed to prevent hospital-acquired
      infections (HAI) by transmission of CPE.

AB  - Surveillance of carbapenem resistance is particularly important for
      Enterobacterales, mainly in countries with limited healthcare resources.
      We conducted a cross-sectional study to detect carbapenem-resistant
      Enterobacterales at 10 sentinel hospitals in Havana, Cuba for a six
      year-period (2016-2021) by the National Reference Laboratory for Health
      Care-Associated Infections in the Pedro Kourí Institute. A total of 152
      isolates were collected with phenotypic production of metallo-β-lactamase.
      NDM-type carbapenemase was detected in all the 152 isolates, and KPC-type
      enzyme gene was simultaneously identified in four NDM-positive isolates.
      The most abundant carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) species
      was Klebsiella pneumoniae (69.7%), followed by Enterobacter cloacae
      complex (13.2%), and Escherichia coli (5.9%). Over the study period, among
      CPE, prevalence of K. pneumoniae was almost constant, while Enterobacter
      spp. showed slightly increasing tendency. The urinary tract (36.2%) was
      the most prevalent source of infection with CPE, followed by bloodstream
      (26.3%) and surgical wound (17.1%), being frequently derived from
      Intensive Care Units (35.5%) and urology wards (21.7%). This study
      revealed the present situation of CPE in hospitals in Havana, Cuba,
      showing the emergence and dissemination of Enterobacterales producing
      NDM-type carbapenemase, mainly K. pneumoniae.

AB  - The increase of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) and lack of
      therapeutic options due to the scarcity of new antibiotics has sparked
      interest toward the use of intravenous fosfomycin against systemic CRE
      infections. We aimed to investigate the in vitro pharmacodynamics of
      fosfomycin against carbapenem-resistant Enterobacter cloacae and
      Klebsiella aerogenes Time-kill studies and population analysis profiles
      were performed with eight clinical CRE isolates, which were exposed to
      fosfomycin concentrations ranging from 0.25 to 2,048 mg/liter. The 24-h
      mean killing effect was characterized by an inhibitory sigmoid maximum
      effect (E(max)) model. Whole-genome sequencing was performed to elucidate
      known fosfomycin resistance mechanisms. Fosfomycin MICs ranged from 0.5 to
      64 mg/liter. The isolates harbored a variety of carbapenemase genes
      including bla(IMP), bla(KPC), and bla(NDM) Five out of eight isolates
      harbored the fosA gene, while none harbored the recently discovered
      fosL-like gene. Heteroresistant subpopulations were detected in all
      isolates, with two out of eight isolates harboring heteroresistant
      subpopulations at up to 2,048 mg/liter. In time-kill studies, fosfomycin
      exhibited bactericidal activity at 2 to 4 h at several fosfomycin
      concentrations (one isolate at ≥16 mg/liter, two at ≥32 mg/liter, two at
      ≥64 mg/liter, two at ≥128 mg/liter, and one at ≥512 mg/liter). At 24 h,
      bactericidal activity was only observed in two isolates (MICs, 0.5 and 4
      mg/liter) at 2,048 mg/liter. From the E(max) model, no significant
      bacterial killing was observed beyond 500 mg/liter. Our findings suggest
      that the use of fosfomycin monotherapy may be limited against CRE due to
      heteroresistance and rapid bacterial regrowth. Further optimization of
      intravenous fosfomycin dosing regimens is required to increase efficacy
      against such infections.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) infections have
      been occasionally described in patients with coronavirus disease-19
      (COVID-19). We assess the clinical features and outcome of these
      infections. METHODS: In this retrospective single-centre, case-control
      study, we included 54 patients with CPE infection: 30 case-patients
      (COVID-19) and 24 controls (non-COVID-19), collected between March and May
      2020. We compared the epidemiological, clinical features, and outcome
      between cases and controls. RESULTS: CPE infection was more frequent in
      COVID-19 patients than in controls (1.1 vs. 0.5%, p = .005). COVID-19
      patients were younger, had a lower frequency of underlying diseases (p =
      .01), and a lower median Charlson score (p = .002). Predisposing factors
      such as antimicrobial use, mechanical ventilation, or ICU admission, were
      more frequent in COVID-19 patients (p < .05). There were 73 episodes of
      infection (42 cases and 31 controls) that were more frequently
      hospital-acquired and diagnosed at the ICU in COVID-19 patients (p <
      .001). Urinary tract was the most common source of infection (47.9%),
      followed by pneumonia (23.3%). The frequency of severe sepsis or shock (p
      = .01) as well as the median SOFA score (p = .04) was higher in cases than
      in controls. Klebsiella pneumoniae (80.8%), Serratia marcescens (11%) and
      Enterobacter cloacae (4.1%) were the most common bacteria in both groups
      (KPC 56.2%, OXA-48 26% and VIM 17.8%). Overall 30-d mortality rate of
      COVID-19 patients and controls was 30 and 16.7%, respectively (p = .25).
      CONCLUSIONS: COVID-19 patients have an increased risk of CPE infections,
      which usually present as severe, nosocomial infections, appearing in
      critically-ill patients and associated with a high mortality.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Enterobacter cloacae complex (ECC) is one of the most common
      extended-spectrum β-lactamase and carbapenemase-producing pathogen that
      threatens millions of the elderly and vulnerable sick persons. The
      objective of this study was to perform the molecular characteristics of
      the carbapenem-resistant E. cloacae complex (CREC) emerged in Heilongjiang
      Province of China. METHODS: Six CREC strains were isolated from the
      patients with infectious diseases. The identities of ECC isolates were
      confirmed by sequencing the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products of
      16S rRNA gene. The characterization of the CREC isolates were analyzed by
      sequencing PCR products of the carbapenemase, ampC and fluoroquinolone
      resistance genes and performing multilocus sequence typing (MLST),
      pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and whole genome sequencing.
      RESULTS: All 6 isolates harbored multiple resistance genes. Of them, 5
      carried metallo-β-lactamases and one was bla(KPC-2)-positive. The
      levofloxacin and ciprofloxacin-resistant strains had substitutions of
      gyrA83, gyrA87, and parC80 in the quinolone-resistance determining
      regions. The MLST analyses revealed that 6 isolates belonged to five
      sequence types (ST520, ST528, ST1119, ST1120, and ST93) while the PFGE
      patterns of the isolates fallen into four clusters. The strain ST1120 was
      found to carry two separated plasmids that encode bla(NDM-1) and
      bla(IMP-4). CONCLUSIONS: Our study, for the first time, identified a CREC
      strain that co-produces bla(NDM-1) and bla(IMP-4) in the Northeast China.
      Our finding emphasizes an urgent need for more intensive surveillance and
      precaution measures to prevent the CERC spread.

      strains has caused treatment failure and is a worldwide threat to public
      health. However, there are limited reports on the prevalence of
      carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) in aquatic environments and
      its association with clinical isolates. This study aimed to investigate
      the prevalence of CPE in a stream environment and its genetic relationship
      with clinical isolates in Korea. METHODS: A total of 4,582 water samples
      were collected from 94 streams. Multiplex PCR and sequencing were used to
      detect and identify six carbapenemase genes. Multi-locus sequence typing
      (MLST) was performed to investigate the genetic relatedness between the
      environmental strains and clinical isolates. RESULTS: A total of 133 CRE
      strains were isolated from the streams. Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most
      common CRE (45.9%), followed by Enterobacter cloacae complex (29.3%),
      Escherichia coli (13.5%), Raoultella ornithinolytica (5.3%), and
      Citrobacter freundii (2.3%). Ninety (67.7%) isolates carried carbapenemase
      genes. K. pneumoniae carbapenemase-2 (36.7%) and New Delhi
      metallo-β-lactamase-5 (32.2%) were the common carbapenemases detected.
      Sequence type (ST)307 and ST11 K. pneumoniae strains harboring the bla
      (KPC-2) gene were the most prevalent in stream and patient samples.
      CONCLUSION: CPE was highly prevalent in streams and closely related to the
      isolates obtained from patients. Therefore, continuous monitoring of
      stream environments is required to control the spread of carbapenem
      resistance.

AB  - PURPOSE: This study aimed to understand the distribution characteristics
      of carbapenemase genes and assess the antimicrobial activities of
      aztreonam/avibactam (ATM/AVI) and ceftazidime/avibactam (CAZ/AVI) against
      carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) isolates in Chongqing,
      Southwest China. METHODS: CRE isolates and their clinical information were
      collected from 22 hospitals covering all the five regions across Chongqing
      between January 1, 2016 and December 31, 2017. PCR was used to screen for
      common carbapenemase genes. And minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs)
      were determined by broth microdilution method. RESULTS: A total of 312
      unduplicated CRE isolates (eg, 206 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 43 Escherichia
      coli, and 42 Enterobacter cloacae) were collected during the two-year
      study period. Among these CRE isolates, 92.3% carried carbapenemase genes,
      with a majority of isolates carrying single bla (KPC-2) (47.1%) or single
      bla (NDM/IPM) (36.2%) and 8.9% of isolates carrying two or three
      carbapenemase genes. Notably, 95.6% (197/206) K. pneumoniae, 86.0% (37/43)
      E. coli and 88.1% (37/42) E. cloacae harbored carbapenemase genes. In
      addition, bla (KPC-2) was prevalent in K. pneumoniae (70.4%), while bla
      (NDM) was predominant in E. coli (83.7%) and E. cloacae (78.6%). Besides,
      only metallo-β-lactamase (MBL) genes were detected in the CRE isolates
      from children. Overall, 0.0%, 48.1%, 59.0%, 61.5% and 63.1% of the CRE
      isolates were resistant to ATM/AVI, CAZ/AVI, nitrofurantoin, amikacin and
      trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, respectively. 99.7% of the total 312
      isolates could be killed by ATM/AVI with the MIC 1 μg/mL, whereas CAZ/AVI
      showed good antibacterial activity (98.0% susceptible) against the bla
      (KPC-2)-carriers with the MIC(50/90) values of 1/4 μg/mL. CONCLUSION: The
      distribution features of carbapenemase genes in Chongqing were
      comprehensively illustrated in terms of species and sources of CRE for the
      first time in this multi-center study that covered all the geographical
      locations across Chongqing. ATM/AVI showed superior activity against all
      CRE isolates regardless of their genotype, whereas CAZ/AVI was active
      against almost all KPC-producers.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We isolated the carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae
      (CPE) strains from children during 2016-2021 in Shanghai, China and
      investigated the antimicrobial resistance, molecular and epidemiological
      features of these isolates. METHODS: Antimicrobial susceptibility tests
      were performed to confirm the carbapenem resistance. Carbapenemase
      production was assessed by the rapid phenotypic identification of five
      major carbapenemases (KPC, NDM, VIM, IMP, and OXA-48), which were further
      confirmed by PCR amplification and sequencing. Multilocus sequence typing
      (MLST) was conducted for phylogenetic analyses. RESULTS: A total of 320
      CPE strains were collected from 2016 to 2021, consisting of
      carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (CP-Kpn, 55.0%), Escherichia
      coli (CP-Eco, 24.5%) and Enterobacter cloacae (CP-Ecl, 20.4%) and others
      (2, 0.1%). NDM was the primary carbapenemase (67.6%) in children, followed
      by KPC(26.4%), IMP(5.3%) and OXA-48 (0.6%). The minimum inhibitory
      concentration (MIC) for imipenem has been increasing from 2016 to 2021.
      NDM and KPC isolates are high resistant while IMP strains show the lower
      resistant to imipenem. Invasive infection accounted for 10.7% of
      CPE-related infections and was mainly caused by CP-Kpn (70.6%). NDM-Kpn
      was detected in 51.8% of infants (70.8% of neonates), while KPC-Kpn was
      mainly isolated from non-infants (56.3%∼64.3%). ST11 was the primary clone
      (64.6%) of KPC-Kpn and presented an increasing trend from 2016 to 2021.
      CONCLUSION: NDM is widely prevalent and transfers among CPE strains in
      children. NDM-Kpn shows the most serious threat to infants, especially to
      neonates. High-risk clone of ST11 KPC-Kpn should be paid more attention
      and monitored continuously in children.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: In China, OXA-48-producing Enterobacterales have been
      identified sporadically, causing small-scale regional outbreaks. This
      study investigated the molecular epidemiology, transmission and evolution
      of OXA-48-producing Enterobacterales and pOXA48 from mainland China.
      METHODS: We conducted a multicentre resistance monitoring project from
      2013-2018. Genome sequencing of OXA-48-produicng isolates was performed.
      SNPs were analysed. Eleven isolates were selected for subsequent SMRT
      sequencing. Genome sequences were annotated, and alignment of the complete
      sequences of bla(OXA-48)-carrying plasmids from a subset of isolates that
      underwent long-read sequencing was performed. RESULTS: In total, 41
      OXA-48-producing Enterobacterales were included in this study (34
      Klebsiella pneumoniae, 3 Escherichia coli, 3 Enterobacter cloacae complex
      and 1 Klebsiella oxytoca). OXA-48-produicng K. pneumoniae (OXAKp) ST383,
      ST147 and ST11 caused outbreaks of different scales in our hospital.
      OXA-48-producing E. coli ST156 and ST648, E. cloacae complex ST414 and
      ST418, and K. oxytoca ST34 were also identified. bla(OXA-48) was embedded
      in a Tn1999.2 structure located in IncL plasmids with different sizes
      (63.58-109.14 kb). Importantly, K. pneumoniae ST11 co-producing KPC-2 and
      OXA-48 was identified in our hospital and it is possible that
      KPC-2-producing K. pneumoniae ST11 obtained the bla(OXA-48)-carrying
      plasmid during its spread. A novel 109-kb bla(OXA-48)-carrying IncL
      plasmid was identified from OXAKp ST11. Possibly, two plasmids in OXAKp
      ST383 were integrated to form this larger plasmid. CONCLUSION:
      OXA-48-produicng Enterobacterales were sporadic in China. Importantly, K.
      pneumoniae ST11 co-producing KPC-2 and OXA-48 has emerged causing an
      outbreak in China. This high-risk multidrug-resistant clone exhibited high
      compatibility and strong integration ability with foreign resistance
      plasmids.

AB  - The usefulness of wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) was proven during
      the COVID-19 pandemic, and the role of environmental monitoring of
      emerging infectious diseases has been recognized. In this study, the
      prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) in Japanese
      environmental samples was measured in the context of applying WBE to CRE.
      A total of 247 carbapenem-resistant isolates were obtained from
      wastewater, treated wastewater, and river water. Treated wastewater was
      shown to be an efficient target for monitoring CRE. The results of the
      isolate analysis showed that WBE may be applicable to Escherichia
      coli-carrying New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM)-type carbapenemase, the
      Enterobacter cloacae complex and Klebsiella pneumoniae complex-carrying
      IMP-type carbapenemase. In addition, a certain number of CRE isolated in
      this study carried Guiana extended spectrum (GES)-type carbapenemase
      although their clinical importance was unclear. Only a few isolates of
      Klebsiella aerogenes were obtained from environmental samples in spite of
      their frequent detection in clinical isolates. Neither the KPC-type, the
      oxacillinase (OXA)-type nor the VIM-type of carbapenemase was detected in
      the CRE, which reflected a low regional prevalence. These results
      indicated the expectation and the limitation of applying WBE to CRE.

AB  - Infection caused by carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) is a
      global public health problem. We performed whole-genome sequencing to
      investigate the molecular epidemiological characteristics of local CRE
      infections and understand the prevalence of hypervirulent
      carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP). Analysis of multiLocus
      sequence typing (MLST), antibiotic resistance genes, plasmid replicons,
      virulence genes, and the genetic environment was also performed.
      Klebsiella pneumoniae (89, 60.95%) was the most common CRE species,
      primarily prevalent in the intensive care unit (36, 40.45%). Most CRE
      strains showed a high resistance rate to multiple antibiotics, especially
      cephalosporins and carbapenems. However, most of these isolates were
      susceptible to tigecycline (81.7%). Notably, the predominant sequence type
      (ST) of CRKP isolates was ST11 (80.90%, 72/89), with 93.05% as Klebsiella
      pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-ST11. In Escherichia coli isolates, ST410
      (21.43%, 6/28) was the predominant type, with approximately half carrying
      bla(NDM-5), and importantly, the ST167 carbapenem-resistant Escherichia
      coli (CRECO) harbors both New Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM)-5 and KPC-2.
      In Enterobacter cloacae isolates, three cases of ST88 were carrying the
      bla(NDM-1) gene, and the ST594 carbapenem-resistant Enterobacter cloacae
      (CRECC) carrying NDM-1 and KPC-2 has also been identified. In addition, we
      found three novel STs, ST5386-ST5388. The IncFII (pHN7A8) (98.41%, 62/63)
      was the most common plasmid replicon type in KPC-2-producing CRKP strains,
      and the predominant plasmid ST of IncF was [f33:A-:B-] (n = 73). Two CRKP
      isolates were found to carry 4 virulence genes (iutA, iroB, rmpA, and
      rmpA2). As concluded, among CRKP strains, ST11 was the predominant ST with
      bla(KPC-2), and a large proportion of CRKP strains co-harbor bla(KPC-2),
      bla(SHV), bla(CTX-M), bla(TEB-1B), and fosA. The predominant carbapenemase
      genes carried by CRECO and CRECC were bla(NDM-1) and bla(CTX-M),
      respectively.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Prompt detection of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) and
      carbapenemase-producing enterobacteriaceae is crucial for infection
      prevention and control strategies. The present study aimed to characterize
      the ESBL and carbapenemase genes among Enterobacter isolates from an
      Iranian inpatient population. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 96
      Enterobacter isolates obtained from inpatients between June 2016 and March
      2017, were identified by the conventional microbiological methods and
      diagnostic kits. Antimicrobial susceptibility pattern was performed using
      the disk diffusion method. The ESBL and carbapenemase genes were screened
      using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). RESULTS: All clinical isolates of
      Enterobacter were classified as E. gergoviae (52, 54.2%), E. aerogenes
      (34, 35.4%), E. cloacae (7, 7.3%), Cronobacter (E). sakazakii (3, 3.1%).
      The highest and lowest antimicrobial resistance rates were observed
      against ampicillin (93.8%) and imipenem (21.9%). High prevalence of
      multi-drug resistance (MDR=96.9%) was substantial. Of the 96 Enterobacter
      isolates, 35 (36.5%) and 28 (29.2%) were phenotypically ESBL-positive and
      non-susceptible carbapenem, respectively. Overall, the frequency of
      evaluated genes was as follows: bla(CTX-M) =25 (26%), bla(TEM) =30
      (31.3%), bla(SHV) =12 (12.5%), bla(IMP) =3 (3.1%), bla(VIM) =0 (0%),
      bla(NDM) =8 (8.3%), and bla(KPC) =0 (0%). CONCLUSION: In this study, we
      report for the first time the presence of E. gergoviae harboring bla(NDM)
      from an Iranian population. Regarding the increase of MDR Enterobacter
      spp. in our region, strict hygiene rules will be needed to control the
      quick spread of ESBL and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacter isolates in
      healthcare facilities of developing countries.

AB  - Infections caused by carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) are
      an emerging threat in both solid organ and stem cell transplant
      recipients. Invasive CPE infections in transplant recipients are
      associated with a high mortality, often due to limited therapeutic options
      and antibacterial toxicities. One of the most therapeutically challenging
      group of CPE are the metallo-β-lactamase (MBL)-producing Gram-negative
      bacteria, which are now found worldwide, and often need treatment with
      older, highly toxic antimicrobial regimens. Newer β-lactamase inhibitors
      such as avibactam have well-established activity against certain
      carbapenemases such as Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPC), but
      have no activity against MBL-producing organisms. Conversely, aztreonam
      has activity against MBL-producing organisms but is often inactivated by
      other co-existing β-lactamases. Here, we report four cases of invasive
      MBL-CPE infections in transplant recipients caused by IMP-4-producing
      Enterobacter cloacae who were successfully treated with a new,
      mechanism-driven antimicrobial combination of ceftazidime/avibactam with
      aztreonam. This novel antimicrobial combination offers a useful treatment
      option for high-risk patients with CPE infection, with reduced drug
      interactions and toxicity.

      were hospitalized in Guangdong Provincial People's Hospital from January
      2018 to June 2021. A total of 1 098 non-repetitive strains of
      Enterobacterales were obtained. Drug sensitivity test, PCR amplification,
      and resistance-related gene sequencing were performed for 66 isolated CRE
      strains to observe molecular epidemiology. RESULTS: Among the 1 098
      strains of Enterobacterales, the detection rate of CRE was 6.01% (66/1
      098). The 66 CRE strains were isolated from 66 children, among whom there
      were 37 boys (56%) and 29 girls (44%), with an age of 2 days to 14 years.
      Among these 66 children, 16 (24%) had an age of 36 months. The children
      with CRE were mainly distributed in the department of neonatology (38
      children, 58%) and the pediatric intensive care unit (17 children, 26%).
      The top three types of specimens with CRE detection were respiratory
      specimens (48%), midstream urine specimens (21%), and blood specimens
      (17%). The CRE strains were mainly Klebsiella pneumoniae (45 strains,
      68%), Escherichia coli (12 strains, 18%), and Enterobacter cloacae (6
      strains, 9%), with high resistance to carbapenems (such as imipenem and
      ertapenem), penicillin, and cephalosporins, slightly high resistance to
      commonly used antibiotics, and relatively low resistance to amikacin
      (14%), levofloxacin (23%), and tobramycin (33%). The carbapenemase
      genotypes of Klebsiella pneumoniae strains were mainly bla(NDM) (20
      strains, 44%), bla(IMP) (10 strains, 22%), and bla(KPC) (5 strains, 11%),
      and the carbapenemase genotypes of Escherichia coli strains were mainly
      bla(NDM) (10 strains, 83%). After sequencing, there were 24 bla(NDM-1)
      strains, 6 bla(NDM-5) strains, 5 bla(IMP-4) strains, and 3 bla(KPC-2)
      strains, and some genotypes were not identified. CONCLUSIONS: There is a
      high incidence rate of CRE infection among children, mainly those aged
      1-12 months. CRE generally has high resistance to antibacterial drugs, and
      metalloenzymes are the main type of carbapenemases for CRE strains in
      children.

AB  - Members of the Enterobacter cloacae complex (ECC) are important
      opportunistic nosocomial pathogens that are associated with a great
      variety of infections. Due to limited data on the genome-based
      classification of species and investigation of resistance mechanisms, in
      this work, we collected 172 clinical ECC isolates between 2019 and 2020
      from three hospitals in Zhejiang, China and performed a retrospective
      whole-genome sequencing to analyze their population structure and drug
      resistance mechanisms. Of the 172 ECC isolates, 160 belonged to 9
      classified species, and 12 belonged to unclassified species based on ANI
      analysis. Most isolates belonged to E. hormaechei (45.14%) followed by E.
      kobei (13.71%), which contained 126 STs, including 62 novel STs, as
      determined by multilocus sequence typing (MLST) analysis. Pan-genome
      analysis of the two ECC species showed that they have an "open" tendency,
      which indicated that their Pan-genome increased considerably with the
      addition of new genomes. A total of 80 resistance genes associated with 11
      antimicrobial agent categories were identified in the genomes of all the
      isolates. The most prevailing resistance genes (12/29, 41.38%) were
      related to β-lactams followed by aminoglycosides. A total of 247
      β-lactamase genes were identified, of which the bla(ACT) genes were the
      most dominant (145/247, 58.70%), followed by the bla(TEM) genes (21/247,
      8.50%). The inherent ACT type β-lactamase genes differed among different
      species. bla(ACT-2) and bla(ACT-3) were only present in E. asburiae, while
      bla(ACT-9), bla(ACT-12), and bla(ACT-6) exclusively appeared in E. kobei,
      E. ludwigii, and E. mori. Among the six carbapenemase-encoding genes
      (bla(NDM-1), bla(NDM-5), bla(IMP-1), bla(IMP-4), bla(IMP-26), and
      bla(KPC-2)) identified, two (bla(NDM-1) and bla(IMP-1)) were identified in
      an ST78 E. hormaechei isolate. Comparative genomic analysis of the
      carbapenemase gene-related sequences was performed, and the corresponding
      genetic structure of these resistance genes was analyzed. Genome-wide
      molecular characterization of the ECC population and resistance mechanism
      would offer valuable insights into the effective management of ECC
      infection in clinical settings. IMPORTANCE The presence and emergence of
      multiple species/subspecies of ECC have led to diversity and complications
      at the taxonomic level, which impedes our further understanding of the
      epidemiology and clinical significance of species/subspecies of ECC.
      Accurate identification of ECC species is extremely important. Also, it is
      of great importance to study the carbapenem-resistant genes in ECC and to
      further understand the mechanism of horizontal transfer of the resistance
      genes by analyzing the surrounding environment around the genes. The
      occurrence of ECC carrying two MBL genes also indicates that the selection
      pressure of bacteria is further increased, suggesting that we need to pay
      special attention to the emergence of such bacteria in the clinic.

AB  - Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) pose a significant threat to
      global public health. The most important mechanism for carbapenem
      resistance is the production of carbapenemases. Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenemase (KPC) represents one of the main carbapenemases worldwide.
      Complex mechanisms of bla(KPC) dissemination have been reported in
      Colombia, a country with a high endemicity of carbapenem resistance. Here,
      we characterized the dynamics of dissemination of bla(KPC) gene among CRE
      infecting and colonizing patients in three hospitals localized in a highly
      endemic area of Colombia (2013 and 2015). We identified the genomic
      characteristics of KPC-producing Enterobacterales recovered from patients
      infected/colonized and reconstructed the dynamics of dissemination of
      bla(KPC-2) using both short and long read sequencing. We found that spread
      of bla(KPC-2) among Enterobacterales in the participating hospitals was
      due to intra- and interspecies horizontal gene transfer (HGT) mediated by
      promiscuous plasmids associated with transposable elements that was
      originated from a multispecies outbreak of KPC-producing Enterobacterales
      in a neonatal intensive care unit. The plasmids were detected in isolates
      recovered in other units within the same hospital and nearby hospitals.
      The gene "epidemic" was driven by IncN-pST15-type plasmids carrying a
      novel Tn4401b structure and non-Tn4401 elements (NTE(KPC)) in Klebsiella
      spp., Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp., and Citrobacter spp. Of note,
      mcr-9 was found to coexist with bla(KPC-2) in species of the Enterobacter
      cloacae complex. Our findings suggest that the main mechanism for
      dissemination of bla(KPC-2) is HGT mediated by highly transferable
      plasmids among species of Enterobacterales in infected/colonized patients,
      presenting a major challenge for public health interventions in developing
      countries such as Colombia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) pose a significant
      global public health threat. Resistance among CRE is particularly complex,
      owing to numerous possible resistance mechanisms and broad definitions. We
      aimed to characterize the clinical and molecular profiles of CRE in the
      South Texas region. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We compared the clinical,
      genotypic, and phenotypic profiles of carbapenemase producing
      Enterobacterales (CPE) with those of non-carbapenemase producers (NCPE)
      isolated from South Texas, United States between 2011 and 2019. Molecular
      characteristics and resistance mechanisms were analyzed using whole-genome
      sequences. RESULTS: The majority (59%) of the CRE isolates were NCPE while
      41% of isolates harbored carbapenemases, predmonantly bla (KPC)-type. The
      most common CPE was Klebsiella pneumoniae while majority of Enterobacter
      cloacae and Escherichia coli were NCPE Among K. pneumoniae, the clonal
      group 307 has emerged as a predmoninant group and was associated with as
      many CRE infections as the previous common clonal group 258. Patients with
      NCPE compared to CPE infections were associated with higher antimicrobial
      exposure prior to culture collection (days of therapy, 795 vs. 242; p <
      0.001) and emergency department visits within past 90 days (22% vs. 4%; p
      = 0.011). The all cause 30-day mortality was 21%. CONCLUSIONS: This study
      highlights the diversity of resistance mechanisms underlying CRE in South
      Texas, with 59% not harboring a carbapenemase. Individuals with NCPE
      infections were more likely to have had prior antimicrobial therapy and
      emergency department visits compared to those with CPE. Identification and
      distinction of these mechanisms by rapid identification of species and
      carbapenemase would allow for optimal treatment and infection control
      efforts.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Klebsiella pneumoniae is the most frequent KPC-producing
      bacteria. The bla(KPC) gene is frequently embedded in Tn4401 transposon,
      and less frequently in non-Tn4401 elements (NTE(KPC)) variants I-III. The
      first case of KPC in the UC-CHRISTUS Clinical Hospital was detected in
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Soon after this event, KPC was detected in 2
      additional Pseudomonas aeruginosa, 3 Escherichia coli, 3 Enterobacter
      cloacae, 3 Klebsiella pneumoniae, and 1 Citrobacter freundii, isolated
      from 6 different patients. We aimed to elucidate the possible mechanisms
      of genetic transfer and dissemination of the bla(KPC) gene among isolates
      of this multispecies outbreak. A molecular epidemiology analysis of the
      above mentioned clinical isolates (n = 13) through Multi-Locus Sequence
      Typing, plasmid analysis, Pulsed-Field Gel-Electrophoresis, and
      Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) was performed. RESULTS: High-risk sequence
      types were found: K. pneumoniae ST11, P. aeruginosa ST654, and E. cloacae
      ST114. All enterobacterial isolates were not clonal except for 3 E. coli
      isolated from the same patient. WGS analysis in 6 enterobacterial isolates
      showed that 4 of them had bla(KPC) embedded in a novel variant of NTE(KPC)
      designated NTE(KPC)-IIe. Upstream of bla(KPC) gene there was a 570 pb
      truncated bla(TEM-1) gene followed by an insertion sequence that was 84%
      similar to ISEc63, a 4473 bp element of the Tn3 family. Downstream the
      bla(KPC) gene there was a truncated ISKpn6 gene, and the inverted repeat
      right sequence of Tn4401. The ISec63-like element together with the
      bla(KPC) gene plus Tn4401 remnants were inserted in the Tra operon
      involved in conjugative transfer of the plasmid. This NTE was carried in a
      broad host-range IncN plasmid. P. aeruginosa isolates carried bla(KPC)
      gene embedded in a typical Tn4401b transposon in a different plasmid,
      suggesting that there was no plasmid transfer between Enterobacteriaceae
      and P. aeruginosa as initially hypothesized. CONCLUSIONS: Most
      enterobacterial isolates had bla(KPC) embedded in the same NTE(KPC)-IIe
      element, suggesting that this multispecies KPC outbreak was due to
      horizontal gene transfer rather than clonal spread. This poses a greater
      challenge to infection control measures often directed against containment
      of clonal spread.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the prevalence and characteristics
      of carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE) from 3 tertiary-care
      Korean university hospitals between 2017 and 2018. Non-duplicated clinical
      isolates of Enterobacteriaceae showing resistance to any carbapenem agents
      were collected prospectively from 3 tertiary university hospitals between
      2017 and 2018. The presence of carbapenemase genes was detected by
      multiplex PCR and sequencing for bla(KPC), bla(VIM), bla(NDM), bla(IMP),
      bla(OXA), and bla(GES) was performed. Among the 690 potential
      carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) isolates, 66.8% (N = 461)
      were CPE. The species distribution of CPE was as follows: Klebsiella
      pneumoniae was most common (75.9%), followed by Escherichia coli (15.0%),
      Citrobacter freundii (4.6%), Enterobacter cloacae (2.6%), Klebsiella.
      aerogenes (0.7%), and Klebsiella. oxytoca (0.4%). All 11 CPE genes were
      detected, particularly K. pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-2 (87.6%), New
      Delhi metallo-β-lactamase (NDM)-1 (7.4%), NDM-5 (1.7%), KPC-3 (1.3%),
      oxacillinase (OXA)-232 (1.1%), and OXA-181 (1.1%). Six isolates produced 2
      or 3 carbapenemases. The majority of the carbapenemase-producing C.
      freundii tested positive for NDM-1. We confirmed a high proportion of CPE
      among the CRE isolates with a high prevalence of KCP-2-producing K.
      pneumoniae and E. coli. Therefore, there is a need for undertaking
      continuous surveillance to monitor the prevalence of CPE.

AB  - PURPOSE: Antimicrobial resistance, especially carbapenem resistance
      Enterobacteriaceae and plasmid mediated mobile colistin resistance, is a
      serious issue worldwide. This study was designed to determine the
      epidemiological characteristics of plasmid mediated colistin resistance
      and carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae from tertiary A hospital
      located in Hefei, China. METHODS: Totally, 158 carbapenems resistant
      Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) were screened for antibiotic susceptibility,
      mcr-1, extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs), metallo-β-lactamases
      (MBLs), and fosfomycin resistance genes using PCR and sequencing. The
      sequence types were identified by multilocus sequence typing (MLST).
      Plasmid profiles were determined by PCR based replicon typing (PBRT), and
      the plasmid sizes were confirmed by southern blotting. RESULTS: The
      isolates showed high MIC(50) and MIC(90) for all antimicrobials, except
      tigecycline, meropenem, and colistin. The main Carbapenemase genes were
      bla (KPC-2) (90.5%), bla (NDM-1)(3.7%), bla (OXA-48)(5.6%) and fosA3
      (14.5%). The bla (CTXM-15) found 36.7%, mcr-1 (3.7%) recorded in six
      isolates. PBRT revealed bla (KPC-2) in K. pneumoniae on IncR, IncFII, and
      IncA/C. bla (NDM-1) in E. coli on IncFII, whereas in E. cloacae noticed on
      IncHI2 plasmid. mcr-1 was recorded among IncFIIK, IncFII, and IncF in E.
      coli, K. pneumoniae, and E. cloacae. Resistance genes (mcr-1, bla (NDM-1),
      bla (KPC-2)) harboring plasmids are successfully trans-conjugant to
      EC-600. A high incidence of ST11 was observed in K. pneumoniae carbapenem
      resistant isolates. While in E. coli, multiple STs were identified.
      However, mcr-1 in ST23 was identified for the first time in Anhui
      Province. Among Enterobacter cloacae, ST270 detected carrying bla (NDM-1).
      Southern-hybridization confirmed the plasmid sizes 35-150kb. CONCLUSION:
      This study indicates the co-carrying of mcr-1, bla (KPC-2,) and bla
      (NDM-1) among clinical isolates, the prevalence of different
      Enterobacteriaceae STs is alarming, especially in E. coli. Holding such a
      resistance profile is a threat for humans and animals, which may be
      transferred between the strains through plasmid transfusion. Persistent
      control actions are immediately necessary to combat this hazard.

      KPC-, NDM- or OXA-48-producing CPE who were hospitalised between 1 January
      2018 and 30 June 2019. Microbiological, demographic and clinical data were
      collected from the patients' computerised files. RESULTS: One type of CPE
      was isolated in 285 patients, including 138 with KPC-CPE, 94 with NDM-CPE
      and 53 with OXA-48-CPE. The most common CPE types were KPC-Klebsiella
      pneumoniae (n = 47), OXA-48-Escherichia coli (n = 38), NDM-Enterobacter
      cloacae complex (n = 35) and KPC-Citrobacter freundii (n = 37). All three
      groups of patients were similar with respect to their risk factors, with
      the exception of previous exposure to antimicrobials that was more common
      in patients with KPC-CPE compared with OXA-48-CPE. Also, these patients
      were more likely to be co-infected by other multidrug-resistant bacteria.
      Clinical infections were more common in KPC-CPE than in OXA-48-CPE
      carriers (9.9% vs. 1.9%; P = 0.033). No other demographic or clinical
      variables were found to be correlated with clinical infections.
      CONCLUSION: Our study suggests that colonisation by OXA-48-CPE might be
      less risky compared with KPC-CPE.

AB  - Introduction. Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) have been
      responsible for nosocomial outbreaks worldwide and have become endemic in
      several countries.Hypothesis/Gap Statement. To better understand the
      epidemiological trends and characteristics of CRE in the Henan
      province.Aim. We assessed the molecular epidemiological characteristics of
      305 CRE strains isolated from patients in 19 secondary or tertiary
      hospitals in ten areas of the Henan province in China.Methodology. A total
      of 305 CRE isolates were subjected to multiple tests, including in vitro
      antimicrobial susceptibility testing, PCR for carbapenemase genes bla
      (KPC), bla (NDM), bla (IMP), bla (VIM), bla (OXA)-(48-like).
      Tigecycline-resistant genes ramR, oqxR, acrR, tetA, rpsJ, tetX, tetM, tetL
      were analysed in five tigecycline non-susceptible carbapenem-resistant
      Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates (TNSCRKP). Additionally, multilocus
      sequence typing (MLST) was performed for carbapenem-resistant K.
      pneumoniae (CRKP).Results. The most common CRE species were K. pneumoniae
      (234, 77 %), Escherichia coli (36, 12 %) and Enterobacter cloacae (13, 4
      %). All strains exhibited multi-drug resistance. Overall, 97 % (295/305)
      and 97 % (297/305) of the isolates were susceptible to polymyxin B and
      tigecycline, respectively. A total of 89 % (271/305) of the CRE isolates
      were carbapenemase gene-positive, including 70 % bla (KPC), 13 % bla
      (NDM), 6 % bla (IMP), and 1 % combined bla (KPC)/bla (NDM) genes. K.
      pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) was the predominant carbapenemase in K.
      pneumoniae (87 %), whereas NDM and IMP were frequent in E. coli (53 %) and
      E. cloacae (69 %), respectively. Mutations in the ramR, tetA, and rpsJ
      genes were detected in five TNSCRKP. Moreover, 15 unique sequence types
      were detected, with ST11 (74 %), ST15 (9 %) and ST2237 (5 %) being
      dominant among K. pneumoniae strains.Conclusion. A high proportion of CRE
      strains were carbapenemase-positive, and five carbapenem-resistant K.
      pneumonia isolates were tigecycline non-susceptible, indicating a need for
      the ongoing surveillance of CRE and effective measures for the prevention
      of CRE infections.

AB  - Novel β-lactam-β-lactamase inhibitor combinations currently approved for
      clinical use are poorly active against metallo-β-lactamase (MBL)-producing
      strains. We evaluated the in vitro activity of cefepime-taniborbactam (FTB
      [formerly cefepime-VNRX-5133]) and comparator agents against
      carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (n = 247) and
      carbapenem-resistant Pseudomonas species (n = 170) clinical isolates
      prospectively collected from different clinical origins in patients
      admitted to 8 Spanish hospitals. FTB was the most active agent in both
      Enterobacterales (97.6% MIC(FTB), ≤8/4 mg/L) and Pseudomonas (67.1%
      MIC(FTB), ≤8/4 mg/L) populations. The MIC(FTB) was >8 mg/L in 6/247 (2.4%)
      Enterobacterales isolates (3 KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates,
      1 VIM-producing Enterobacter cloacae isolate, 1 IMP-producing E. cloacae
      isolate, and 1 NDM-producing Escherichia coli isolate) and in 56/170
      (32.9%) Pseudomonas isolates, 19 of them carbapenemase producers (15
      producers of VIM, 2 of GES, 1 of GES+VIM, and 1 of GES+KPC). Against the
      Enterobacterales isolates with meropenem MICs of >2 mg/L (138/247), FTB
      was the most active agent against both serine-β-lactamases (107/138) and
      MBL producers (31/138) (97.2 and 93.5% MIC(FTB), ≤8/4 mg/L, respectively),
      whereas the activity of comparators was reduced, particularly against the
      MBL producers (ceftazidime-avibactam, 94.4 and 12.9%,
      meropenem-vaborbactam, 85.0 and 64.5%, imipenem-relebactam, 76.6 and 9.7%,
      ceftolozane-tazobactam, 1.9 and 0%, and piperacillin-tazobactam, 0 and 0%,
      respectively). Among the meropenem-resistant Pseudomonas isolates
      (163/170; MIC, >2 mg/L), the activities of FTB against serine-β-lactamase
      (35/163) and MBL (43/163) producers were 88.6 and 65.1%, respectively,
      whereas the susceptibilities of comparators were as follows:
      ceftazidime-avibactam, 88.5 and 16.0%, meropenem-vaborbactam, 8.5 and
      7.0%, imipenem-relebactam, 2.9 and 2.3%, ceftolozane-tazobactam, 0 and
      2.3%, and piperacillin-tazobactam, 0 and 0%, respectively. Microbiological
      results suggest FTB as a potential therapeutic option in patients infected
      with carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales and carbapenem-resistant
      Pseudomonas isolates, including MBL producers.

AB  - Colistin is often used as a drug of last resort against infections caused
      by multi-drug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, including
      carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE). Recently, the acquisition of
      mobile colistin resistance (mcr) genes by CRE has become a cause for
      concern. This study investigated the prevalence of mcr genes in CRE
      isolates in Seoul, Republic of Korea. In total, 3675 CRE strains were
      collected from patients between 2018 and 2019, and initially screened for
      mcr genes using multiplex polymerase chain reaction assays. Upon the
      identification of mcr-harbouring strains, colistin susceptibility tests,
      identification of carbapenemase and β-lactamase genes, and plasmid
      replicon typing were performed. Clonal analysis was conducted using
      pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. mcr genes were detected in 2.2%
      (80/3675) of CRE strains. There were three mcr-1 carriers, one mcr-4.3
      carrier, one mcr-4.3/mcr-9 carrier, 58 mcr-9 carriers, one mcr-9/mcr-10
      carrier and 16 mcr-10 carriers among various Enterobacterales species, of
      which 60 were Enterobacter cloacae complex (ECC) strains. The prevalence
      of mcr genes in ECC strains was 20.5%. Molecular detection confirmed that
      21.3% and 13.8% of mcr-harbouring strains shared bla(NDM-1) or bla(KPC-2),
      respectively. In addition, an IncHI2 replicon was identified in 71.7% of
      mcr-9 strains. Comparative analysis revealed not only a notable diversity
      of mcr carriers, but also clonal spreading or nosocomial outbreaks of some
      ECC strains. These findings revealed a silent distribution of mcr genes in
      CRE strains with high genetic heterogeneity in Seoul, underscoring the
      urgent need for timely intervention to control and prevent mcr
      dissemination.

AB  - The nosocomial spread of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) is
      extremely common, resulting in severe burdens on healthcare systems. In
      particular, the high-risk Klebsiella pneumoniae ST11 strain has a wide
      endemic area in China. The current study describes the results of
      continuous monitoring of CRE genotypes and phenotypes in a tertiary
      hospital in North China from 2012 to 2020. A total of 160 isolates were
      collected, including 109 Klebsiella. pneumoniae (68.13%), 29 Escherichia
      coli (26.60%), 12 Enterobacter cloacae (7.50%), and 10 other strains
      (6.25%). A total of 149 carbapenemase genes were detected, of which
      bla(KPC)(-2) (51.0%) was the most common, followed by bla(NDM)(-1)
      (22.82%), and bla(NDM)(-5) (23.49%). Based on multi-locus sequence typing,
      the ST11 strain (66.1%) dominates K. pneumoniae, followed by ST15 (13.8%).
      Interestingly, the proportion of bla(NDM) (22.2%, 16/72) in ST11 K.
      pneumoniae was significantly increased in 2018-2019. Hence, whole-genome
      sequencing was performed on ST11 K. pneumoniae. Growth curves and in vitro
      competition experiments showed that K. pneumoniae carrying bla(NDM)
      exhibited a stronger growth rate (p < 0.001) and competition index (p <
      0.001) than K. pneumoniae carrying bla(KPC). Moreover, K. pneumoniae
      carrying bla(NDM) had a stronger biofilm-forming ability than K.
      pneumoniae carrying bla(KPC) (t = 6.578; p < 0.001). K. pneumoniae
      carrying bla(KPC) exhibited increased defense against bactericidal
      activity than K. pneumoniae carrying bla(NDM). Thus, ST11 K. pneumoniae
      carrying bla(NDM) has strong adaptability and can locally replace K.
      pneumoniae carrying bla(KPC) to become an epidemic strain. Based on these
      findings, infection control and preventive measures should focus on the
      high-risk ST11-K. pneumoniae strain.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: We compared the activity of 8 novel β-lactam and
      tetracycline-derivative antibiotics against a cohort of clinical
      carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE) isolates and investigated the
      incremental susceptibility benefit of the addition of an aminoglycoside,
      fluoroquinolone, or polymyxin to the β-lactam agents to assist with
      empiric antibiotic decision making. METHODS: A collection of consecutive
      CRE clinical isolates from unique patients at 3 US hospitals (2016-2021)
      was assembled. Broth microdilution was performed to obtain antimicrobial
      susceptibility testing results. Mechanisms of carbapenem resistance were
      investigated through short-read and long-read whole-genome sequencing.
      RESULTS: Of the 603 CRE isolates, 276 (46%) were carbapenemase producing
      and 327 (54%) were non-carbapenemase producing, respectively. The
      organisms most frequently identified were Klebsiella pneumoniae (38%),
      Enterobacter cloacae complex (26%), and Escherichia coli (16%). We
      obtained the following percent susceptibility to novel β-lactam agents:
      ceftazidime-avibactam (95%), meropenem-vaborbactam (92%),
      imipenem-relebactam (84%), and cefiderocol (92%). Aminoglycosides and the
      polymyxins provided greater incremental coverage as second agents,
      compared to fluoroquinolones. Amikacin and plazomicin exhibited the
      greatest additive value. Ceftazidime-avibactam, meropenem-vaborbactam, and
      cefiderocol were active against 94% of the 220 KPC-producing isolates.
      Cefiderocol was active against 83% of the 29 NDM-producing isolates.
      Ceftazidime-avibactam had 100% activity against the 9
      OXA-48-like-producing isolates. Tigecycline had the highest activity
      compared to other tetracyclines against KPC, NDM, or OXA-48-like-producing
      isolates. CONCLUSION: Selection among novel agents requires a nuanced
      understanding of the molecular epidemiology of CRE. This work provides
      insights into the comparative activity of novel agents and the additive
      value of a second antibiotic for empiric antibiotic decision making.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Infections caused by drug-resistant Enterobacterales including
      those producing metallo-β-lactamases (MBLs) are particularly challenging
      due to limited therapeutic options. The drug combination
      aztreonam/avibactam (ATM-AVI) is under clinical development for treating
      serious infections caused by these strains. This study assessed the in
      vitro activity of ATM-AVI against Enterobacterales isolates collected
      globally in the ATLAS surveillance programme in 2019. METHODS: Clinical
      isolates of Enterobacterales (N = 18 713) including Citrobacter freundii,
      Citrobacter koseri, Enterobacter cloacae complex, Escherichia coli,
      Klebsiella aerogenes, Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus
      mirabilis, and Serratia marcescens collected from 232 sites in 2019 were
      analysed. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by reference
      broth microdilution. A pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic based breakpoint of
      8 mg/L was considered for ATM-AVI activity. RESULTS: ATM-AVI demonstrated
      potent antimicrobial activity against all Enterobacterales, with 99.9%
      isolates inhibited at MIC ≤8 mg/L (MIC(90), 0.25 mg/L). MICs ≤8 mg/L
      (>99.0%) were noted for ATM-AVI across regions worldwide. Among other
      antimicrobials, amikacin, colistin, imipenem, meropenem, and tigecycline
      were also active (susceptibility >85.0%) against Enterobacterales.
      Activity of ATM-AVI was sustained against multidrug-resistant,
      extended-spectrum β-lactamase producing, and carbapenem-resistant isolates
      (susceptibility >99%; MIC(90), 0.25-0.5 mg/L). Importantly, potent
      activity for ATM-AVI (>99.0%; MIC(90,) 0.5 mg/L) was noted among
      MBL-positive isolates and those producing other carbapenemases, such as
      KPC and OXA-48. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrated that ATM-AVI was
      highly active against a recent collection of Enterobacterales isolates,
      including those producing MBLs either alone or in combination with other
      carbapenemases. Thus, ATM-AVI represents a potential option for treating
      infections caused by antibiotic-resistant Enterobacterales including
      MBL-producing strains.

AB  - The development of antibiotic resistance is a major public health issue,
      as infections are increasingly unresponsive to antibiotics. Emerging
      antimicrobial resistance has raised researchers' interest in the
      development of alternative strategies using natural compounds with
      antibacterial activity, like honey, which has emerged as an agent to treat
      several infections and wound injuries. Nevertheless, the antibacterial
      effect of honey was mostly evaluated against Gram-positive bacteria.
      Hence, the objective of our study was to evaluate the antibacterial
      activity, as well as the physicochemical parameters, of genuine Greek
      honeys against multidrug-resistant Gram-negative pathogenic bacteria. In
      this vein, we aimed to study the in vitro antibacterial potential of rare
      Greek honeys against Verona integron-encoded metallo-β-lactamase (VIM)- or
      Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase-producing multidrug-resistant
      Gram-negative pathogens. Physicochemical parameters such as pH, hydrogen
      peroxide, free acidity, lactonic acid, total phenols total flavonoids,
      free radical scavenging activities, tyrosinase enzyme inhibitory activity
      and kojic acid were examined. Moreover, the antimicrobial activity of 10
      different honey types was evaluated in five consecutive dilutions (75%,
      50%, 25%, 12.5% and 6.25%) against the clinical isolates by the well
      diffusion method, as well as by the determination of the minimum
      inhibition concentration after the addition of catalase and protease.
      Almost all the physicochemical parameters varied significantly among the
      different honeys. Fir and manuka honey showed the highest values in pH and
      H(2)O(2), while the free acidity and lactonic acid levels were higher in
      chestnut honey. Total phenols, total flavonoids and free radical
      scavenging activities were found higher in cotton, arbutus and manuka
      honey, and finally, manuka and oregano honeys showed higher tyrosinase
      inhibition activity and kojic acid levels. The antimicrobial
      susceptibility depended on the type of honey, on its dilution, on the
      treatment methodology and on the microorganism. Arbutus honey was the most
      potent against VIM-producing Enterobacter cloacae subsp. dissolvens in 75%
      concentration, while fir honey was more lethal for the same microorganism
      in the 25% concentration. Many honeys outperformed manuka honey in their
      antibacterial potency. It is of interest that, for any given concentration
      in the well diffusion method and for any given type of honey, significant
      differences were not detected among the four multidrug-resistant
      pathogens, which explains that the damaging effect to the bacterial cells
      was the same regardless of the bacterial species or strain. Although the
      antimicrobial potency of different honey varieties dependents on their
      geographical origin and on their compositional differences, the exact
      underlying mechanism remains yet unclear.

AB  - Early development of the microbiome has been shown to affect general
      health and physical development of the infant and, although some studies
      have been undertaken in high-income countries, there are few studies from
      low- and middle-income countries. As part of the BARNARDS study, we
      examined the rectal microbiota of 2,931 neonates (term used up to 60 d)
      with clinical signs of sepsis and of 15,217 mothers screening for
      bla(CTX-M-15), bla(NDM), bla(KPC) and bla(OXA-48)-like genes, which were
      detected in 56.1%, 18.5%, 0% and 4.1% of neonates' rectal swabs and 47.1%,
      4.6%, 0% and 1.6% of mothers' rectal swabs, respectively.
      Carbapenemase-positive bacteria were identified by MALDI-TOF MS and showed
      a high diversity of bacterial species (57 distinct species/genera) which
      exhibited resistance to most of the antibiotics tested. Escherichia coli,
      Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae/E. cloacae complex, the
      most commonly found isolates, were subjected to whole-genome sequencing
      analysis and revealed close relationships between isolates from different
      samples, suggesting transmission of bacteria between neonates, and between
      neonates and mothers. Associations between the carriage of antimicrobial
      resistance genes (ARGs) and healthcare/environmental factors were
      identified, and the presence of ARGs was a predictor of neonatal sepsis
      and adverse birth outcomes.

CY  - Switzerland
AB  - Purpose: To investigate the susceptibility of carbapenemase-producing
      Enterobacterales (CPE) to mecillinam based on the recently updated
      European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST)
      breakpoints for uncomplicated Urinary Tract Infection (uUTI). Methods: The
      challenge collection consisted of 105 molecularly characterized
      Enterobacterales [Klebsiella spp. (N = 49), Escherichia coli (N = 30),
      Enterobacter cloacae (n = 13), Citrobacter freundii (N = 9), Proteus
      mirabilis (N = 3), and Raoultella ornithinolytica (N = 1)]. Isolates
      produced OXA-48 (N = 18), OXA-48-like (N = 18), VIM (N = 22), NDM (N =
      22), KPC (N = 12), IMI (N = 9), IMP (N = 6), GES (N = 1), OXA-58 (N = 2)
      or combinations thereof (N = 5). MICs of carbapenems were determined by
      agar gradient diffusion (AGD). MICs of mecillinam were assessed by agar
      dilution (reference method) and compared to disk diffusion (DD) and AGD.
      Results: Overall 23/105 CPE (21.9%) were susceptible to mecillinam.
      Susceptibility was observed in E. coli (N = 12), E. cloacae (N = 7), and
      Klebsiella pneumoniae (N = 4) producing IMI, OXA-48, OXA-48-like, and
      NDM-1 carbapenemases. MIC(50) for mecillinam in all isolates was 128 mg/L
      while MIC(50) for meropenem was 8 mg/L. Lower MICs for mecillinam were
      found in IMI (MIC(50) 8 mg/L) and OXA-48-like (MIC(50) 16 mg/L) producers.
      The comparison of the different susceptibility methods showed very major
      errors of 12.2% with AGD and 8.5% with disk diffusion when compared to the
      reference method. Conclusion: Mecillinam susceptibility was restricted to
      isolates producing IMI-, OXA-48-like, and NDM-1 carbapenemases and was
      documented despite high carbapenem MICs in some isolates. Mecillinam could
      be a promising oral antimicrobial in uUTI caused by E. coli and E. cloacae
      isolates carrying IMI- and OXA-48-like carbapenemases; however,
      susceptibility testing by AGD and disk diffusion remains problematic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales (CRE), currently listed
      by the World Health Organization (WHO) as top priority critical pathogens,
      are a major global menace to human health. In low- and middle-income
      countries (LMICs) the threat is mounting fueled by selective pressures
      caused by antibiotic abuse and inadequate diagnostic resources. METHODS:
      This study phenotypically and genotypically characterized carbapenem
      resistance among 115 Enterobacterales isolates including 76 Klebsiella
      (K.) pneumoniae, 19 Escherichia (E.) coli, 14 Shigella (S.) sonnei, 5
      Enterobacter (E.) cloacae, and 1 Proteus (P.) mirabilis. RESULTS:
      Ninety-three isolates (80.9%) were carbapenem-resistant with an alarming
      57.5% carbapenem non-susceptibility in isolates collected from the
      outpatient department. Molecular characterization of the carbapenemases
      (CPases) encoding genes showed that bla(NDM) (80.5%) was the most
      prevalent; it was detected in 62 isolates (54 K. pneumoniae, 6 E. coli and
      2 S. sonnei), followed by bla(VIM) (36.4%) which was observed in 28
      isolates (24 K. pneumoniae, 3 E. coli and 1 E. cloacae). Other CPases
      included bla(KPC) (28.6%; in 20 K. pneumoniae, 1 E. coli and 1 S. sonnei),
      bla(OXA-48) (26%; in 17 K. pneumoniae, 1 E. coli,1 E. cloacae and 1 P.
      mirabilis), bla(IMP) (6.5%; in 5 K. pneumoniae) and bla(SPM) (1.3%; in K.
      pneumoniae). Notably more than half of the Enterobacterales isolates
      (54.5%) co-harboured more than one CPase-encoding gene. Co-existence of
      bla(NDM) and bla(VIM) genes was the most dominant (31.2%), followed by
      association of bla(NDM) and bla(KPC) (24.7%), then bla(VIM) and bla(KPC)
      (13%). Moreover, the effects of different genotypes on meropenem MIC
      values were assessed, and a statistically significant difference between
      the genotype (Ambler classes A and B) and the genotype (Ambler classes B
      and D) was recorded. CONCLUSION: The current findings may serve for a
      better understanding of the context of CRE in Egypt, associated drivers
      and CPases.

AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the antimicrobial activities of ceftazidime/avibactam
      (CAZ/AVI) and aztreonam/avibactam (ATM/AVI) against carbapenem-resistant
      Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) isolates collected from three secondary hospitals
      in Southwest China between 2018 and 2019. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total
      of 120 unique CRE clinical isolates were collected and carbapenemase genes
      were detected using PCR. Antimicrobial susceptibility was determined using
      standard broth microdilution method and the results were interpreted
      according to CLSI breakpoints. RESULTS: The 120 carbapenem-resistant
      strains included 92 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 10 Escherichia coli, 10
      Enterobacter cloacae, five Klebsiella aerogenes, and three Klebsiella
      oxytoca isolates. Seventy-four percent of these 120 CRE isolates were
      collected from patients located in non-ICUs; 65.0% of these CRE isolates
      were collected from male patients; and 34.2% of these isolates were
      isolated from respiratory tracts. Four different carbapenemase genes were
      identified among 103 carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae (CPE)
      isolates, including bla (KPC-2) (n=77), bla (NDM-1) (n=16), bla (NDM-5)
      (n=12) and bla (IMP-4) (n=2). Overall, 21.7%, 37.5%, 40.8%, 75.0%, and
      100% of the CRE strains were susceptible to levofloxacin,
      trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, amikacin, CAZ/AVI, and ATM/AVI,
      respectively. In addition, antimicrobial susceptibility testing showed
      that 96.7% isolates (n=116) were resistant to aztreonam, and the addition
      of avibactam (4 mg/L) significantly reduced the MICs of those
      aztreonam-resistant isolates by more than 128-fold (range: ≤0.125-4 mg/L),
      and 90.0% (n=108) of total 120 isolates were inhibited at ATM/AVI
      concentration ≤1 mg/L. CONCLUSION: Our study revealed significant
      antimicrobial resistance among the CRE isolates against some commonly used
      antibiotics in three secondary Chinese hospitals. ATM/AVI exhibited potent
      activity against CRE isolates, including double carbapenemase-producing
      isolates, whereas CAZ/AVI was active against all KPC producers.

AB  - Introduction. Increasing numbers of carbapenemase-producing
      Enterobacterales (CPE), which can be challenging to treat, have been
      referred to the national reference laboratory in England since the early
      2000s.Gap Statement/Aim. Previous studies on CPE in the UK have focussed
      on localized outbreaks. We applied whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to
      isolates referred to the national reference laboratory over 30 months to
      inform our understanding of CPE epidemiology in England.Methodology. The
      first confirmed CPE from each new patient referred by an English
      diagnostic laboratory between 1 January 2014 and 30 June 2016 was
      sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500. Multiple isolates from the same
      patient were included from either different species or the same species
      with different carbapenemase genes. The data were analysed using an
      in-house bioinformatics pipeline that determines species identification,
      multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) profile and antimicrobial resistance
      gene content.Results. A total of 2658 non-duplicate CPE were sequenced
      amongst which three host organisms belonging to diverse sequence types
      (STs) predominated: Klebsiella pneumoniae (1380/2658, 51.9 %; 177 STs),
      Escherichia coli (723/2658, 27.2 %; 133 STs) and Enterobacter cloacae
      (294/2658, 11.1 %; 88 STs). Thirty different carbapenemase gene variants
      were identified, although bla (OXA-48-like) (1122/2658, 42.2%), bla (NDM)
      (692/2658, 26.0 %), bla (KPC) (571/2658, 21.5 %), bla (VIM) (100/2658, 3.8
      %) and bla (IMP) (33/2658, 1.2 %) predominated. ST/carbapenemase gene
      pairings represented widely distributed high-risk clones or clusters at a
      regional or hospital level.Conclusion. CPE referred to the national
      reference laboratory are diverse, suggesting multiple introductions to
      England and a role for horizontal transfer of carbapenemase genes in
      English CPE epidemiology.

CY  - Netherlands
AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular
      mechanisms of imipenem resistance in Enterobacteriaceae and to assess the
      antimicrobial activities of ceftazidime/avibactam (CAZ/AVI) and
      aztreonam/avibactam (ATM/AVI) against imipenem-resistant clinical isolates
      in a tertiary hospital in China. METHODS: A total of 91 imipenem-resistant
      Enterobacteriaceae were collected and genes encoding carbapenemases,
      ESBLs, AmpC β-lactamases and porins were detected using PCR. MICs and
      susceptibility were determined using in-house-prepared broth microdilution
      panels and were interpreted according to CLSI breakpoints. RESULTS:
      Imipenem-resistant isolates comprising 54 Klebsiella pneumoniae, 18
      Escherichia coli, 8 Enterobacter cloacae, 6 Serratia marcescens, 3
      Klebsiella oxytoca and 2 Klebsiella aerogenes were collected
      independently. Five different carbapenemase genes were identified, namely
      bla(KPC-2) (n = 60), bla(NDM-5) (n = 14), bla(NDM-1) (n = 11), bla(KPC-3)
      (n = 4) and bla(IMP-4) (n = 1). Among the 91 carbapenem-resistant
      Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), 85 isolates harboured at least one ESBL and/or
      AmpC gene, including 5 strains without carbapenemase-encoding genes.
      Moreover, 31 K. pneumoniae carried ompK35 and/or ompK36 mutations. MLST
      results showed that the K. pneumoniae belonged to 12 different STs, with
      ST11 being predominant (29/54; 53.7%). Overall, 17.6%, 25.3%, 41.8%, 65.9%
      and 100% of the CRE strains were susceptible to amikacin,
      trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole, tetracycline, CAZ/AVI and ATM/AVI,
      respectively. CONCLUSION: This study revealed that CRE isolates differ
      significantly in their species, STs, porins and carbapenemase genes in a
      single Chinese hospital. ATM/AVI exhibited potent activity against CRE
      isolates, even for the most notorious double-carbapenemase-producers with
      porin defects, whereas CAZ/AVI was active against all the
      non-metallo-β-lactamase-producing isolates.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Concerns are growing over the importance of the hospital water
      environment for the transmission of carbapenemase-producing
      Enterobacteriaceae (CPE). AIM: To report a large outbreak in the
      cardiology units involving intensive care units (ICUs) and wards at a
      tertiary-care hospital. METHODS: This was a contact tracing, case-control
      study to find the risk factors for acquisition of CPE and environmental
      sampling was performed during a CPE outbreak between July and December
      2018. FINDINGS: A total of 87 patients with CPE infection or colonization
      were identified in the cardiology units of the Asan Medical Centre.
      Diverse organisms were identified containing bla(kpc), bla(NDM-1),
      bla(VIM) or bla(IMP), bla(OXA-48,) and co-producing organisms. A
      case-control study indicated that using the sinks in the ward patient room
      bathroom for teeth brushing was associated with CPE acquisition (83% vs
      30%; P=0.03). The environment was cultured and Klebsiella pneumoniae
      carbapenemase (KPC)-producing Escherichia coli was isolated from a water
      dispenser and New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM) 1-producing
      Citrobacter freundii and Enterobacter cloacae from sinks in patient rooms.
      Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis of KPC-producing E. coli
      from patients and the water dispenser in ICU and NDM-1-producing E.
      cloacae from the patient and sink drain showed the same pulsotypes.
      CONCLUSIONS: The water dispenser and sink drain were suspected as possible
      reservoirs of CPE in this outbreak. Close contacts with contaminated water
      such as tooth brushing were identified as risk factors for CPE
      acquisition. Education for the adequate use of the water environment
      system as well as the control of the hospital water environment should be
      implemented to prevent the CPE outbreaks.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the molecular characteristics of
      carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) from county hospitals in
      China. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-three sequential non-duplicate CRE
      strains (including 33 Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates, 4 Enterobacter
      cloacae isolates, 3 Escherichia coli isolates, 1 Serratia marcescens, 1
      Morganella morganii and 1 Citrobacter freundii) were collected from 4
      county hospitals and 2 municipal hospitals. Antimicrobial susceptibility
      testing was conducted by broth microdilution method, using
      3-aminophenylboronic acid and EDTA and the modified carbapenem
      inactivation method (mCIM) to screen phenotype of carbapenemase.
      β-Lactamases were characterized by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA
      sequencing. The transferability of bla (NDM-5) was investigated by
      transformation experiment. Clonal relatedness was evaluated by
      pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and multilocus sequence typing . RESULTS:
      The results of antimicrobial susceptibility testing indicated that 43 CRE
      strains were resistant to most of the antimicrobial agents, except
      tigecycline and colistin. Overall, 93%, 93%, and 97.7% of these strains
      were resistant to imipenem, meropenem, and ertapenem, respectively. PCR
      and DNA sequencing indicated that 67.4% (29/43) were bla (KPC-2) positive
      isolates, in which 3.4% (1/29) was coproduced with bla (NDM-1). In
      addition, 7.0% (3/43), 4.7% (2/43), 4.7% (2/43), 2.3% (1/43), 2.3% (1/43)
      were bla (NDM-1), bla (NDM-16), bla (NDM-4), bla (NDM-5), bla (IMP-4)
      positive isolates, respectively. The 29 bla (KPC-2)-positive isolates
      belonged to 12 different PFGE type and designated as ST11 (n=20) and ST15,
      ST39, ST116, ST667, ST2245, ST2338. The plasmid bearing bla (NDM-5) could
      be transferred into recipient E. coli J53 through transformation.
      CONCLUSION: Our study indicated the dissemination of CRE between the
      tertiary hospitals and secondary hospitals.

AB  - AIM: This report presents phenotypic and genetic data on the prevalence
      and characteristics of extended-spectrum β-lactamases (ESBLs) and
      representative carbapenemases-producing Gram-negative species in Mexico.
      MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 52 centers participated, 43
      hospital-based laboratories and 9 external laboratories. The distribution
      of antimicrobial resistance data for Escherichia coli, Klebsiella
      pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae complex, Acinetobacter baumannii complex,
      and Pseudomonas aeruginosa in selected clinical specimens from January 1
      to March 31, 2020 was analyzed using the WHONET 5.6 platform. The
      following clinical isolates recovered from selected specimens were
      included: carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae, ESBL or
      carbapenem-resistant E. coli, and K. pneumoniae, carbapenem-resistant A.
      baumannii complex, and P. aeruginosa. Strains were genotyped to detect
      ESBL and/or carbapenemase-encoding genes. RESULTS: Among blood isolates,
      A. baumannii complex showed more than 68% resistance for all antibiotics
      tested, and among Enterobacteria, E. cloacae complex showed higher
      resistance to carbapenems. A. baumannii complex showed a higher resistance
      pattern for respiratory specimens, with only amikacin having a resistance
      lower than 70%. Among K. pneumoniae isolates, blaTEM, blaSHV, and blaCTX
      were detected in 68.79%, 72.3%, and 91.9% of isolates, respectively. Among
      E. coli isolates, blaTEM, blaSHV, and blaCTX were detected in 20.8%,
      4.53%, and 85.7% isolates, respectively. For both species, the most
      frequent genotype was blaCTX-M-15. Among Enterobacteriaceae, the most
      frequently detected carbapenemase-encoding gene was blaNDM-1 (81.5%),
      followed by blaOXA-232 (14.8%) and blaoxa-181(7.4%), in A. baumannii was
      blaOXA-24 (76%) and in P. aeruginosa, was blaIMP (25.3%), followed by
      blaGES and blaVIM (13.1% each). CONCLUSION: Our study reports that NDM-1
      is the most frequent carbapenemase-encoding gene in Mexico in
      Enterobacteriaceae with the circulation of the oxacillinase genes 181 and
      232. KPC, in contrast to other countries in Latin America and the USA, is
      a rare occurrence. Additionally, a high circulation of ESBL blaCTX-M-15
      exists in both E. coli and K. pneumoniae.

CY  - Switzerland
AB  - OBJECTIVE: In intensive care units (ICUs), carbapenem-resistant
      Enterobacterales (CRE) pose a significant threat. We aimed to examine the
      distribution, epidemiological characteristics, and risk factors for CRE
      positivity in ICUs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study was
      conducted in 96 ICUs of 78 hospitals in Henan Province, China. The
      clinical and microbiological data were collected. A multivariable logistic
      regression model was used to analyze the risk factors for CRE positivity.
      RESULTS: A total of 1,009 patients were enrolled. There was a significant
      difference in CRE positive rate between pharyngeal and anal swabs (15.16
      vs. 19.13%, P < 0.001). A total of 297 carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella
      pneumoniae (CR-KPN), 22 carbapenem-resistant Escherichia coli (CR-ECO), 6
      carbapenem-resistant Enterobacter cloacae (CR-ECL), 19 CR-KPN/CR-ECO, and
      2 CR-KPN/CR-ECL were detected. Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC),
      New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM), and a combination of KPC and NDM
      were detected in 150, 9, and 11 swab samples, respectively. Multivariable
      logistic regression analysis determined length of ICU stay, chronic
      neurological disease, transfer from other hospitals, previous infection,
      and history of antibiotics exposure as independent risk factors for CRE
      positivity. Age and cardiovascular diseases were independent risk factors
      for mixed infections of CRE. The occurrence of CRE in secondary and
      tertiary hospitals was 15.06 and 25.62%, respectively (P < 0.05). Patients
      from tertiary hospitals had different clinical features compared with
      those from secondary hospitals, including longer hospital stays, a higher
      rate of patients transferred from other hospitals, receiving renal
      replacement therapy, exposure to immunosuppressive drugs, use of
      antibiotics, and a higher rate of the previous infection. CONCLUSION: In
      ICUs in Henan Province, CRE positive rate was very high, mostly KPC-type
      CR-KPN. Patients with prolonged ICU stay, chronic neurological disease,
      transfer from other hospitals, previous infection, and history of
      antibiotic exposure are prone to CRE. Age and cardiovascular diseases are
      susceptibility factors for mixed infections of CRE. The CRE positive rate
      in tertiary hospitals was higher than that in secondary hospitals, which
      may be related to the source of patients, antibiotic exposure, disease
      severity, and previous infection.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore the in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility among
      clinically important Gram-negative bacteria (GNB) in Taiwan. METHODS: From
      2016 through 2018, a total of 5458 GNB isolates, including Escherichia
      coli (n = 1545), Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 1255), Enterobacter species (n
      = 259), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (n = 1127), Acinetobacter baumannii complex
      (n = 368), and Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (n = 179), were collected. The
      susceptibility results were summarized by the breakpoints of minimum
      inhibitory concentration (MIC) of CLSI 2020, EUCAST 2020 (for colistin),
      or published articles (for ceftolozane/tazobactam). The resistance genes
      among multidrug-resistant (MDR) or extensively drug-resistant (XDR)-GNB
      were investigated by multiplex PCR. RESULTS: Significantly higher rates of
      non-susceptibility (NS) to ertapenem and carbapenemase production,
      predominantly KPC and OXA-48-like beta-lactamase, were observed in
      Enterobacterales isolates causing respiratory tract infection than those
      causing complicated urinary tract or intra-abdominal infection
      (12.7%/3.44% vs. 5.7%/0.76% or 7.7%/0.97%, respectively). Isolates of
      Enterobacter species showed higher rates of phenotypic extended-spectrum
      β-lactamase and NS to ertapenem than E. coli or K. pneumoniae isolates.
      Although moderate activity (54-83%) was observed against most potential
      AmpC-producing Enterobacterales isolates, ceftolozane/tazobactam exhibited
      poor in vitro (44.7-47.4%) activity against phenotypic AmpC Enterobacter
      cloacae isolates. Additionally, 251 (22.3%) P. aeruginosa isolates
      exhibited the carbapenem-NS phenotype, and their MDR and XDR rate was
      63.3% and 33.5%, respectively. Fifteen (75%) of twenty Burkholderia
      cenocepacia complex isolates were inhibited by ceftolozane/tazobactam at
      MICs of ≤4 μg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: With the increase in antibiotic resistance
      in Taiwan, it is imperative to periodically monitor the susceptibility
      profiles of clinically important GNB.

AB  - Rapid diagnosis of infections caused by carbapenem-resistant
      Enterobacteriaceae (CRE) is crucial for proper treatment and infection
      control. The Xpert Carba-R assay is a qualitative multiplex real-time PCR
      method that qualitatively detects and differentiates five common
      carbapenemase genes (bla(KPC), bla(NDM), bla(VIM), bla(OXA-48), and
      bla(IMP)) directly from rectal swabs or purified colonies within
      approximately 1 h. We performed a multicenter evaluation of the
      investigational use of the Carba-R assay for detection and differentiation
      of carbapenemase genes from sputum specimens in patients with a clinical
      diagnosis of pneumonia. The intra- and interassay coefficients of
      variation values for the Carba-R assay were 0.2% to 2.0% and 1.4% to 2.3%,
      respectively. A total of 301 sputum specimens were collected and tested.
      Compared to bacterial culture followed by PCR identification of resistance
      genes from colonies, the Carba-R assay reduced turnaround time from 56 to
      84 h to less than 2 h. Carbapenemase genes were detected by the Carba-R
      assay in Klebsiella pneumoniae (n = 236), Escherichia coli (n = 22),
      Enterobacter cloacae (n = 23), Klebsiella oxytoca (n = 8), Serratia
      marcescens (n = 6), Citrobacter freundii (n = 4), and Klebsiella aerogenes
      (n = 2). The Carba-R assay detected 112 bla(KPC) (33.5%), 70 bla(NDM)
      (21.0%), 8 bla(IMP) (2.4%), and 2 bla(VIM) (0.6%) genes, with positive
      percent agreement, negative percent agreement, and concordance rates of
      92.9%, 86.7%, and 88.3%, respectively, for the dominant bla(KPC) and
      85.0%, 87.8%, and 87.4%, respectively, for the bla(NDM) genes. Neither
      method detected the bla(OXA-48) carbapenemase gene. The convenient, rapid,
      and simple characteristics of the Xpert Carba-R assay make it a potential
      tool for CRE detection and identification directly in sputum specimens.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The worldwide spread of organisms with antimicrobial
      resistance is of concern, especially the trend of significantly increasing
      carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE). In this study, we
      investigated the annual trend of intestinal CPE carriage rates in
      inpatients and healthy adults in a primary care hospital in Tenri, Japan.
      METHODS: We collected 551 samples of feces from inpatients in our
      institution and 936 samples from healthy people living in Tenri city from
      December 2012 to April 2015. All samples were cultured on MacConkey agar
      plates containing 4 μg/mL ceftazidime for screening test. The colonies
      grown on the screening medium were detected for carbapenemase genes
      (bla(IMP-1), bla(IMP-2), bla(VIM), bla(KPC), bla(GES), bla(NDM), and
      bla(OXA-48) groups) by multiplex PCR, and CPE were identified by MALDI-TOF
      MS. Plasmid replicon typing and pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE)
      were performed on PCR-positive strains. RESULTS: The CPE carriage rate was
      1.6% (9/551) in the inpatient group and 0% (0/936) in the healthy adults
      group. The numbers of strains positive for the carbapenemase gene were 4
      for Enterobacter cloacae, 2 for Klebsiella pneumoniae, 1 for Citrobacter
      freundii, 1 for Raoultella ornithinolytica and 1 for Escherichia coli. In
      all CPE strains, the carbapenemase gene was bla(IMP-6) and the plasmid
      replicon type was IncN. The 4 E. cloacae strains showed a similar pattern
      in PFGE. CONCLUSION: In the same city in Japan, CPE intestinal carriers
      were detected only in the inpatient group in this study but not in a
      healthy adults, suggesting that the spread of asymptomatic CPE carriers
      was confined to inpatients.

AB  - Carbapenemase-producing Enterobacterales (CPE) have become an important
      public health concern. In our hospital, VIM enzymes were first detected in
      2005, Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) enzymes in 2009, and
      OXA-48 enzymes in 2012. We assess the population biology of the first
      OXA-48-producing Enterobacterales isolates recovered in our hospital (2012
      to 2013) where infections by other carbapenemases had been endemic for
      several years. Over a 21-month period, 71 isolates (61 Klebsiella
      pneumoniae, 5 Escherichia coli, 2 Klebsiella aerogenes, and 1 each of
      Enterobacter cloacae, Klebsiella oxytoca, and Citrobacter amalonaticus)
      recovered from clinical and surveillance specimens from 57 patients (22.8%
      nonhospitalized) were investigated for OXA-48-like-producing enzymes.
      Analyses for characterization and determination of the location of the
      bla(OXA-48) gene, plasmid transferability, sequence, and clonal
      relatedness were performed. Most of the isolates also coproduced CTX-M-15
      (57/71, 80.3%) and/or VIM-1 (7/71, 9.8%). K. pneumoniae was predominantly
      identified as sequence type 11 (ST11) (63.4%) and ST405 (9.8%) and E. coli
      as ST540, ST1406, ST3163, and ST4301. The bla(OXA-48) gene was part of
      Tn1999.2 located at the tir gene of plasmids (ca. ≥50 kb) of the IncL/M
      group, also carrying bla(VIM-1) and bla(CTX-M-15) genes. We selected one
      ST11 K. pneumoniae isolate for whole-genome sequencing in which we studied
      the plasmid containing the bla(OXA-48) gene. This plasmid was compared
      with indexed plasmids existing in NCBI database by the use of BRIG and
      MAUVE. Our data suggest a rapid spread of bla(OXA-48) genes between
      commonly isolated high-risk clones of Enterobacterales species, frequently
      associated with antibiotic resistance. Moreover, the emergence of the
      multiresistant ST11 K. pneumoniae clone among nonhospitalized patients
      emphasizes the difficulty of preventing its dissemination into the
      community.IMPORTANCE We present results of microbiological analysis of the
      first Enterobacterales isolates that were isolated in 2012 in our
      institution expressing OXA-48 carbapenemase. This enzyme confers
      resistance to carbapenems, an important group of antibiotics widely used
      in the hospitals. OXA-48 carbapenemase is currently present in many parts
      of the world, but it is found particularly frequently in the Mediterranean
      area. It was disseminated at the Ramón y Cajal Hospital and found to be
      associated with a particular Klebsiella pneumoniae strain, so-called
      high-risk clone ST11, which was previously found in our institution in
      association with other enzymes such as CTX-M-15, VIM-1, and KPC-3. This
      clone might have acquired a plasmid harboring the bla(OXA-48) gene. Our
      results point out the importance of local epidemiology in the
      dissemination and maintenance of multidrug-resistant bacteria.

AB  - Diabetes is a leading non-communicable disease and a risk factor for
      relapsing infections. The current study was aimed at investigating the
      prevalence and antibiotic susceptibility of carbapenem-resistant (CR)
      uropathogens of the family Enterobacteriaceae in diabetic patients. The
      data of 910 bacterial isolates was collected from diagnostic laboratories
      during January 2018 to December 2018. The bacterial isolates were
      identified using traditional methods including colonial characteristics,
      biochemical tests, and API (20E). Antimicrobial susceptibility and
      phenotypic characterization of ESBL, MBLs, and KPC was determined by
      utilizing CLSI recommended methods. The phenotypically positive isolates
      were further analyzed for resistance-encoding genes by manual PCR and
      Check-MDR CT103XL microarray. Susceptibility to colistin and cefiderocol
      was tested in accordance with CLSI guidelines. The data revealed that most
      of the patients were suffering from type 2 diabetes for a duration of more
      than a year and with uncontrolled blood sugar levels. Escherichia coli and
      Klebsiella pneumoniae were the most frequently encountered pathogens,
      followed by Enterobacter cloacae and Proteus mirabilis. More than 50% of
      the isolates showed resistance to 22 antibiotics, with the highest
      resistance (>80%) against tetracycline, ampicillin, and cefazolin. The
      uropathogens showed less resistance to non-β-lactam antibiotics, including
      amikacin, fosfomycin, and nitrofurantoin. In the phenotypic assays, 495
      (54.3%) isolates were found to be ESBL producers, while ESBL-TEM and -PER
      were the most prevalent ESBL types. The resistance to carbapenems was
      slightly less (250; 27.5%) than ESBL producers, yet more common amongst E.
      coli isolates. MBL production was a common feature in carbapenem-resistant
      isolates (71.2%); genotypic characterization also validated this trend.
      The isolates were found to be sensitive against the new drugs, cefiderocol
      and eravacycline. with 7-28% resistance, except for P. mirabilis which had
      100% resistance against eravacycline. This study concludes that a few
      types of ESBL and carbapenemases are common in the uropathogens isolated
      from the diabetic patients, and antibiotic stewardship programs need to be
      revisited, particularly to cure UTIs in diabetic patients.

AB  - The Australian Group on Antimicrobial Resistance (AGAR) performs regular
      period-prevalence studies to monitor changes in antimicrobial resistance
      in selected enteric gram-negative pathogens. The 2018 survey was the sixth
      year to focus on bloodstream infections, and included Enterobacterales,
      Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter species. Eight thousand three
      hundred and fifty isolates, comprising Enterobacterales (7,512, 90.0%), P.
      aeruginosa (743, 8.9%) and Acinetobacter species (95, 1.1%), were tested
      using commercial automated methods. The results were analysed using
      Clinical and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) and European Committee
      on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST) breakpoints (January
      2019). Of the key resistances, resistance to the third-generation
      cephalosporin, ceftriaxone, was found in 13.4%/13.4% of Escherichia coli
      (CLSI/EUCAST criteria), and 9.4%/9.4% of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Resistance
      rates to ciprofloxacin were 15.2%/15.2% for E. coli, 11.3%/11.3% for K.
      pneumoniae, 7.4%/7.4% for Enterobacter cloacae complex, and 3.6%/7.7% for
      P. aeruginosa. Resistance rates to piperacillin-tazobactam were 3.0%/6.0%,
      4.3%/7.9%, 18.2%/22.0%, and 5.1%/11.1% for the same four species
      respectively. Thirty-one isolates from 27 patients were shown to harbour a
      carbapenemase gene: 14 bla(IMP-4) (11 patients), including one with
      bla(IMP-4)+bla(OXA-23), four bla(KPC) (three patients), three bla(OXA-48),
      three bla(NDM), three bla(GES), two bla(OXA-181), and two bla(OXA-23).

AB  - BACKGROUND: There has been an increase in the number of
      carbapenemase-producing organisms documented across the UK over the past
      10 years. From these, the 'big five' carbapenemases (KPC, OXA-48, IMP,
      VIM, and NDM) are the most common types reported in the order
      Enterobacterales, identified from a variety of reactive screening,
      outbreak, inpatient surveillance, and diagnostic samples. AIM: To perform
      a point prevalence study to determine the inpatient carriage rate of
      carbapenemase-producing organisms at Barts Health NHS Trust, which
      encompasses 2.5 million patients across four London boroughs: Tower
      Hamlets, Newham, Redbridge, and Waltham Forest. METHODS: Rectal swabs were
      collected from consenting inpatients, alongside details of the ward's
      medical specialty, patient's country of birth, history of foreign travel,
      length of hospitalization, and history of prior hospitalization. Swabs
      were enriched and subcultured on to mSuperCARBA selective medium. All
      Enterobacterales, Acinetobacter, and Pseudomonas species were identified
      by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass
      spectroscopy and underwent antibiotic susceptibility testing by disc
      diffusion, according to European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility
      Testing (EUCAST) guidelines. All isolates were screened for the 'big five'
      carbapenemases using a modified version of a published reverse
      transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction assay. FINDINGS: Of the 977
      inpatients tested, 35 CPOs were isolated from 30 patients. NDM was the
      most frequently detected carbapenemase, followed by OXA-48, with an
      overall prevalence of 3.1%. Organisms isolated included Klebsiella
      pneumoniae, Enterobacter cloacae, Proteus mirabilis, and Escherichia coli.
      Renal and elderly care patients had the highest prevalences of CPOs,
      whereas the intensive care unit prevalence was low. Statistical analysis
      found that hospitalization abroad, any previous hospitalization, foreign
      travel and, specifically, travel to India, Pakistan, and Bangladesh were
      associated with increased risk of CPO carriage. CONCLUSION: The overall
      prevalence of CPOs at Barts Health Trust was 3.1%, comprising NDM and
      OXA-48-type carbapenemases, which is in line with other London-based
      studies. Renal patients and the elderly had the highest burden of CPOs,
      whereas previous hospitalization and foreign travel were associated with
      an increased risk of CPO carriage.

AB  - Bacterial resistance to antibiotics has proven difficult to control over
      the past few decades. The large group of multidrug-resistant bacteria
      includes carbapenemase-producing bacteria (CPB), for which limited
      therapeutic options and infection control measures are available.
      Furthermore, carbapenemases associate with high-risk clones that are
      defined by the sequence type (ST) to which each bacterium belongs. The
      objectives of this cross-sectional and retrospective study were to
      describe the CPB population isolated in a third-level hospital in Southern
      Spain between 2015 and 2020 and to establish the relationship between the
      ST and the epidemiological situation defined by the hospital. CPB were
      microbiologically studied in all rectal and pharyngeal swabs and clinical
      samples received between January 2015 and December 2020, characterizing
      isolates using MicroScan and mass spectrometry. Carbapenemases were
      detected by PCR and Sanger sequencing, and STs were assigned by multilocus
      sequence typing (MLST). Isolates were genetically related by pulsed-field
      gel electrophoresis using Xbal, Spel, or Apal enzymes. The episodes in
      which each CPB was isolated were recorded and classified as involved or
      non-involved in an outbreak. There were 320 episodes with CPB during the
      study period: 18 with K. pneumoniae, 14 with Klebisella oxytoca, 9 with
      Citrobacter freundii, 11 with Escherichia coli, 46 with Enterobacter
      cloacae, 70 with Acinetobacter baumannii, and 52 with Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa. The carbapenemase groups detected were OXA, VIM, KPC, and NDM
      with various subgroups. Synchronous relationships were notified between
      episodes of K. pneumoniae and outbreaks for ST15, ST258, ST307, and ST45,
      but not for the other CPB. There was a major increase in infections with
      CPB over the years, most notably during 2020, coinciding with the COVID-19
      pandemic. This study highlights the usefulness of gene sequencing
      techniques to control the spread of these microorganisms, especially in
      healthcare centers. These techniques offer faster results, and a reduction
      in their cost may make their real-time application more feasible. The
      combination of epidemiological data with real-time molecular sequencing
      techniques can provide a major advance in the transmission control of
      these CPB and in the management of infected patients. Real-time sequencing
      is essential to increase precision and thereby control outbreaks and
      target infection prevention measures in a more effective manner.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Studies describing the activity of imipenem/relebactam against
      gram-negative bacilli (GNB) isolated from pediatric patients are lacking
      in the peer-reviewed literature. We address this deficiency by reporting
      on GNB tested against imipenem/relebactam as part of the Study for
      Monitoring Antimicrobial Resistance Trends global surveillance program.
      METHODS: In 2015-2017, 221 laboratories in 59 countries collected 9149
      consecutive, aerobic or facultative GNB from pediatric patients (age <18
      years) and 100 785 from adult patients with intraabdominal, respiratory,
      and urinary tract infections. Susceptibility was determined using Clinical
      and Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) broth microdilution methodology
      and CLSI breakpoints (and US Food and Drug Administration breakpoints for
      imipenem/relebactam). RESULTS: The 4 most common species of GNB isolated
      from pediatric patients were Escherichia coli (40.4%), Pseudomonas
      aeruginosa (17.1%), Klebsiella pneumoniae (13.9%), and Enterobacter
      cloacae (4.7%); non-Morganellaceae Enterobacterales (NME) accounted for
      70.1% of isolates. Imipenem/relebactam inhibited 97.8% of NME from
      pediatric patients; susceptibility to imipenem was 1.9% lower, and
      susceptibility to β-lactam comparators (cefepime, ceftazidime,
      ceftriaxone, piperacillin/tazobactam) was 9.2-25.2% lower.
      Imipenem/relebactam inhibited 94.2% of P. aeruginosa from pediatric
      patients; susceptibility to imipenem was 16.2% lower, and susceptibility
      to β-lactam comparators was 10.2-15.6% lower. Susceptibility was generally
      slightly higher for isolates from pediatric than adult patients. All K.
      pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC)-positive isolates, 93.3% of
      multidrug-resistant (MDR) NME isolates, and 70.5% of MDR P. aeruginosa
      isolates from pediatric patients were susceptible to imipenem/relebactam.
      CONCLUSIONS: Imipenem/relebactam provides a new treatment option for
      infections caused by resistant gram-negative bacilli, including
      KPC-positive NME, MDR NME, and MDR P. aeruginosa.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To describe the genotypes of the carbapenemases reported from
      microbiological isolates of patients in Peru. METHODS: A systematic search
      of the biomedical literature about carbapenemases with genotypic
      confirmation was carried out. It included literature published from 1
      January 2000 through 15 September 2019 in the PubMed, SCOPUS, Virtual
      Health Library, CONCYTEC Virtual Library, and Google Scholar databases,
      and other sources for the publication of abstracts or posters from
      national or international meetings. Two reviewers carried out the data
      selection and extraction. RESULTS: Fourteen studies, which carried out the
      genotypic characterization of 313 carbapenemases, were included. Of the
      total 313 reports, 103 analyzed enterobacteria: 74 were of Klebsiella
      pneumoniae, 11 of Proteus mirabilis, 7 of Enterobacter cloacae, and 11 of
      other enterobacteria; and 61 corresponded to bla (NDM) , 39 to bla (KPC,)
      and 3 to bla (IMP) . According to their molecular structure, 64 were
      metallo-ß-lactamases and 39 were serine-ß-lactamases. Of the total
      reports, 84 analyzed Pseudomonas aeruginosa: 79 corresponded to bla (IMP)
      , 4 to bla (VIM) , and 1 to bla (GES.) Of the total reports, 126 analyzed
      Acinetobacter baumannii: 55 corresponded to bla (OXA-23) , 66 to bla
      (OXA-24) , 3 to bla (NDM,) and 2 to bla (OXA-143) . CONCLUSIONS: There is
      a limited number of publications about carbapenemases among patients in
      Peru. The genotype reports come primarily from hospitals in the country's
      capital. This is the first review that aims to identify the types of
      carbapenemases reported in enterobacteria, P. aeruginosa, and A. baummani.

      carbapenemases was determined by phenotypic (according to the Malbrán
      algorithm) and genotypic methods (amplification of the blaNDM-1 and blaKPC
      genes by PCR) in clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae during the period
      March-August 2018. RESULTS: 605 Enterobacteriaceae of different species
      were identified, being Escherichia coli the strain with the highest
      percentage of isolation (61.3%), followed by Klebsiella pneumoniae
      (14.9%). Sixteen strains (2.64%) were positive for carbapenemases
      production: 13 strains of K. pneumoniae and three of the Enterobacter
      cloacae complex. PCR showed that 14 strains (87.5%) carry the blaNDM-1
      gene and two strains (12.5%) the blaKPC gene; 100% agreement was observed
      between phenotypic determination and PCR for both groups of enzymes.
      CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study showed a higher incidence of
      metallo-β-lactamase type NDM-1, which rapid dissemination and consequently
      difficult control has been cause of epidemiological alert. The
      identification of the type of enzyme would allow establishing more
      accurate management and control strategies in order to eradicate these
      pathogens.
